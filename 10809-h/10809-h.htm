<h2>PREFACE</h2>
<p>We are not politicians, and we belong to different schools of
political thought. We have written this book to set forth the
causes of the present war, and the principles which we believe to
be at stake. We have some experience in the handling of historic
evidence, and we have endeavoured to treat this subject
historically. Our fifth chapter, which to many readers will be the
most interesting, is founded upon first-hand evidence&mdash;the
documents contained in the British White Book (Parliamentary Paper,
Cd. 7467; hereafter cited as <i>Correspondence respecting the
European Crisis</i>), and the German White Book, which is an
official apology, supplemented by documents. The German White Book,
as being difficult of access, we have printed <i>in extenso</i>. It
exists in two versions, a German and an English, both published for
the German Government. We have reproduced the English version
without correcting the solecisms of spelling and expression. From
the English White Book we have reprinted, in the second appendix, a
small selection of the more significant documents; many more are
quoted in the body of our work.</p>
<p>Our thanks are due to Sir H. Erle Richards, Chichele Professor
of International Law and Diplomacy; and to Mr. W.G.S. Adams,
Gladstone Professor of Political Theory and Institutions, for
valuable suggestions and assistance.</p>
<p>The sole responsibility for the book rests, however, with those
who sign this Preface.</p>
<p>Any profits arising from the sale of this work will be sent to
the Belgian Relief Fund, as a mark of sympathy and respect for the
Belgian nation, and especially for the University of Louvain.</p>

<p>By the courtesy of His Excellency the Russian Ambassador we are
now able to print in an appendix (No. VI) those documents contained
in the Russian Orange Book which have not been already published in
the German and the British White Books. In the light of the
evidence afforded by the Russian Orange Book, we have modified one
or two sentences in this edition.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER I</h2>
<center>THE NEUTRALITY OF BELGIUM AND LUXEMBURG</center>
<h3>I</h3>
<p>The kingdom of Belgium is a comparatively new creation, but the
idea of a Belgian nation is older than the kingdom. Historically
and geographically the kingdom has no doubt an artificial
character; its boundaries have been determined by the Great Powers
and cut across the ancient provinces of the Netherlands. And it
must be added that its population is heterogeneous both in race and
language. These facts, however, in no sense diminish the legal
rights of Belgium as a nation. She is a sovereign state by the same
charter as Italy or Greece; and for the convenience of Europe she
has been solemnly declared a neutral state, endowed with special
privileges but burdened with corresponding obligations. While those
privileges were maintained&mdash;and they have been rigidly
maintained for more than eighty years&mdash;the Belgian people
punctually fulfilled their obligations; and, because they have
declined to betray Europe by becoming the dependant of a powerful
neighbour, or by participating in the violation of European public
law, their country is a wilderness of smoking ruins.</p>
<p>In the tremendous and all but crushing ordeal of August, 1914,
Belgium has proved that she possesses other titles to existence and
respect than those afforded by treaties, by the mutual jealousies
of neighbours, or by the doctrines of international law. She has
more than satisfied the tests which distinguish the true from the
fictitious nationality. Those who have hitherto known Belgium only
as a hive of manufacturing and mining industry, or as a land of
historic memories and monuments, are now recognizing, with some
shame for their past blindness, the moral and spiritual qualities
which her people have developed under the aegis of a European
guarantee. It is now beyond dispute that, if Belgium were
obliterated from the map of Europe, the world would be the poorer
and Europe put to shame. The proofs which Belgium has given of her
nationality will never be forgotten while liberty has any value or
patriotism any meaning among men. We cannot do less than echo the
general sentiment of admiration for a constancy to national ideals
which has left Belgium at the mercy of Huns less forgivable than
those of Attila. But the case against her oppressor is not to be
founded solely or mainly on her peculiar merits. In a special sense
it rests upon the legal rights and duties with which she has been
invested for the convenience of her neighbours and for the welfare
of the European state system. It was in their interest, rather than
her own, that the Great Powers made her a sovereign independent
state. As such she is entitled, equally with England or with
Germany, to immunity from unprovoked attack. But the Powers which
made her a sovereign state, also, and for the same reasons of
convenience, made her a neutral state. She was therefore debarred
from consulting her own safety by making alliances upon what terms
she would. She could not lawfully join either of the two armed
camps into which Europe has fallen since the year 1907. And, if she
had been as contemptible as she is actually the reverse, she would
still be entitled to expect from England and from every other of
her guarantors the utmost assistance it is in their power to give.
In fighting for Belgium we fight for the law of nations; that is,
ultimately, for the peace of all nations and for the right of the
weaker to exist.</p>
<hr />
<p>The provinces which now constitute the kingdom of
Belgium&mdash;with the exception of the bishopric of Li&egrave;ge,
which was until 1795 an ecclesiastical principality&mdash;were
known in the seventeenth century as the Spanish, in the eighteenth
as the Austrian, Netherlands. They received the first of these
names when they returned to the allegiance of Philip II, after a
short participation in the revolt to which Holland owes her
national existence. When the independence of Holland was finally
recognized by Spain (1648), the Spanish Netherlands were subjected
to the first of the artificial restrictions which Europe has seen
fit to impose upon them. The Dutch monopoly of navigation in the
Scheldt was admitted by the Treaty of M&uuml;nster (1648), and
Antwerp was thus precluded from developing into a rival of
Amsterdam. In the age of Louis XIV the Spanish Netherlands were
constantly attacked by France, who acquired at one time or another
the chief towns of Artois and Hainault, including some which have
lately come into prominence in the great war, such as Lille,
Valenciennes, Cambray, and Maubeuge. The bulk, however, of the
Spanish Netherlands passed at the Treaty of Utrecht to Austria,
then the chief rival of France on the Continent. They passed with
the reservation that certain fortresses on their southern border
were to be garrisoned jointly by the Dutch and the Austrians as a
barrier against French aggression. This arrangement was overthrown
at the French Revolution. The French annexed the Austrian
Netherlands and Li&egrave;ge in November, 1792; and immediately
afterwards threw down a gauntlet to England by opening to all
nations the navigation of the Scheldt. This, and the threatened
French attack on Holland, her ally, drew England into conflict with
the Revolution; for, first, Antwerp in French hands and as an open
port would be a dangerous menace; and secondly, the French had
announced a new and anarchic doctrine hostile to all standing
treaties: 'Our reasons are that the river takes its rise in France
and that a nation which has obtained its liberty cannot recognize a
system of feudalism, much less adhere to it'.[<a href=
"#note-1">1</a>] The answer of William Pitt, which in effect
declared war upon the Revolution, contains a memorable statement of
the attitude towards public law which England held then, as she
holds it to-day: 'With regard to the Scheldt France can have no
right to annul existing stipulations, unless she also have the
right to set aside equally the other treaties between all Powers of
Europe and all the other rights of England and her allies....
England will never consent that France shall arrogate the power of
annulling at her pleasure and under the pretence of a pretended
natural right, of which she makes herself the only judge, the
political system of Europe, established by solemn treaties and
guaranteed by the consent of all the Powers'.[<a href=
"#note-2">2</a>]</p>
<p>This was not our attitude in the case of Belgium only. It was an
attitude which we adopted with regard to all the minor Powers of
Western Europe when they were threatened by Napoleon. On precisely
the same grounds England defended in 1803 the independence of
Holland, a commercial rival if an old political ally, and of
Switzerland, where she had no immediate interests to protect. By
the Treaty of Lun&eacute;ville (February, 1801) France and Austria
had mutually guaranteed the independence of the Batavian Republic
and the right of the Dutch to adopt whatever form of government
seemed good to them. In defiance of these stipulations Napoleon
maintained a garrison in Holland, and forced upon her a new
Constitution which had been prepared in Paris (November, 1801).
Identical stipulations had been made for the Helvetian Republic and
had been similarly violated. Early in 1803 England demanded that
the French should evacuate Holland and Switzerland: to which
Napoleon replied that 'Switzerland and Holland are mere trifles'.
His interview with the English Ambassador on March 13, 1803, has
many points of resemblance with the now famous interview of August
4, 1914, between Sir Edward Goschen and Dr. von Bethmann-Hollweg.
The First Consul then, like the Imperial Chancellor to-day, was
unable, or professed himself unable, to understand why Great
Britain should insist upon the observance of treaties.</p>
<p>To return to Belgium. It became apparent in the Napoleonic Wars
that Belgium and Holland were individually too weak to protect
themselves or the German people against an aggressive French
Government. The allies therefore, in the year 1813, handed over to
Holland the Austrian Netherlands and the bishopric of Li&egrave;ge
in order 'to put Holland in a position to resist attack until the
Powers could come to its aid'. This arrangement was ratified at the
Treaty of Chaumont (1814). As there was no government or visible
unity in the Belgian provinces after the retirement of the French,
the union with Holland, originally suggested by Lord Castlereagh,
seemed reasonable enough. It gave the Belgians the great privilege
of freely navigating the Scheldt. It was confirmed at the Congress
of Vienna, and the new kingdom of the United Netherlands was
declared neutral by the common consent of the Powers.</p>
<p>But the events of the years 1815-1830 proved conclusively that
this union was unsatisfactory to the Belgian population. The
Belgians complained that they were not allowed their just share of
influence and representation in the legislature or executive. They
resented the attempt to impose the Dutch language and Dutch
Liberalism upon them. They rose in revolt, expelled the Dutch
officials and garrisons, and drew up for themselves a monarchical
and parliamentary constitution. Their aspirations aroused much
sympathy both in England and in France. These two countries induced
the other Great Powers (Austria, Prussia, Russia) to recognize the
new kingdom as an independent neutral state. This recognition was
embodied in the Treaty of the Twenty-Four Articles signed at London
in October, 1831; and it was not too generous to the aspirations of
Belgian nationality. Since the Belgians had been defeated in the
field by Holland and had only been rescued by a French army, they
were obliged to surrender their claims upon Maestricht, parts of
Luxemburg, and parts of Limburg. Some time elapsed before this
settlement was recognized by Holland. But at length this last
guarantee was obtained; and the Treaty of London, 1839, finally
established the international status of Belgium. Under this treaty
both her independence and her neutrality were definitely guaranteed
by England, France, Austria, Prussia, and Russia.</p>
<p>We have recently been told by the Imperial Chancellor that the
Treaty of 1839 is nothing but 'a scrap of paper'. It is therefore
desirable to point out that Bismarck made full use of it in 1870 to
prevent England from supporting the cause of France. It was with
this object that he published the proposal alleged to have been
made to him by the French representative, Benedetti, in 1866, that
Prussia should help France to acquire Belgium as a solace for
Prussian annexations in Northern Germany. Then, as now, England
insisted upon the Treaty of 1839. The result was that, on the
instance of Lord Granville, Germany and France entered into an
identic treaty with Great Britain (Aug. 1870) to the effect that,
if either belligerent violated Belgian territory, Great Britain
would co-operate with the other for the defence of it. The treaty
was most strictly construed. After the battle of Sedan (Sept. 1870)
the German Government applied to Belgium for leave to transport the
German wounded across Belgian territory. France protested that this
would be a breach of neutrality and Belgium refused.</p>
<p>Such is the history of the process by which Belgium has acquired
her special status. As an independent state she is bound by the
elementary principle of the law of nations, that a neutral state is
bound to refuse to grant a right of passage to a belligerent. This
is a well-established rule, and was formally affirmed by the Great
Powers at the Hague Peace Conference of 1907. The fifth Article of
the Convention [<a href="#note-3">3</a>] then drawn up respecting
the Rights and Duties of Neutral Powers and Persons in War on Land
runs as follows:&mdash;</p>
<p class="blockquote">'A neutral power ought not to allow on its
territory any of the acts referred to in Articles 2 to 4'.</p>
<p>Of the Articles thus specified the most important is No.
2:&mdash;</p>
<p class="blockquote">'Belligerents are forbidden to move across
the territory of a neutral power troops or convoys, either of
munitions of war or supplies'.</p>
<p>By the Treaty of London the existence of Belgium is contingent
upon her perpetual neutrality:&mdash;</p>
<p class="blockquote">'ARTICLE VII. Belgium within the limits
specified in Articles I, II, and IV shall form an independent and
perpetually neutral state. It shall be bound to observe such
neutrality towards all other states'.[<a href="#note-4">4</a>]</p>
<p>It is unnecessary to elaborate further the point of law. That,
it seems, has been admitted by the Imperial Chancellor before the
German Reichstag. What is necessary to remember is that, in regard
to Belgium, Germany has assumed the position which the Government
of the French Revolution adopted towards the question of the
Scheldt, and which Napoleon adopted towards the guaranteed
neutrality of Switzerland and Holland. Now, as then, England has
special interests at stake. The consequences of the oppression or
the extinction of the smaller nationalities are bound to excite
peculiar alarm in England. In particular she cannot forget how she
would be menaced by the establishment of a militarist state in
Belgium. But since in England's case the dangers and uncertainties
of a state of things in which Might is treated as Right are
particularly apparent, it is only to be expected that she should
insist with special emphasis upon the sanctity of treaties, a
sanctity which in the long run is as necessary to the strongest
nation as to the weakest. If treaties count for nothing, no nation
is secure so long as any imaginable combination of Powers can meet
it in battle or diplomacy on equal terms; and the stronger nations
must perforce fight one another to the death for the privilege of
enslaving civilization. Whether the progress of such a competition
would be a trifling evil, whether the success of any one among such
competitors would conduce to the higher interests of humanity,
impartial onlookers may debate if they please. England has answered
both these questions with an unhesitating negative.</p>
<h3>II</h3>
<p>Under existing treaty law the Grand Duchy of Luxemburg stands
for all practical purposes in the same legal position as its
northern neighbour; and the ruler of Luxemburg has protested
against the German invasion[<a href="#note-5">5</a>] of her
territory no less emphatically than King Albert, though with less
power of giving expression in action to her just resentment. If the
defence of Belgium has appealed more forcibly to the ordinary
Englishman, it is because he is more familiar with the past history
of Belgium and sees more clearly in her case the ultimate issues
that are involved in the German violation of her rights. As the
following narrative will show, the neutrality of Luxemburg was
guaranteed in the interests and at the instance of the Prussian
state, as a protection against French aggression. The legal case
could not be clearer, and it might perhaps be asked why the attack
on Luxemburg, which preceded that on Belgium, was not treated by
this country as a <i>casus belli</i>. England's attitude towards
Luxemburg is that which she has consistently adopted towards those
smaller states of Europe which lie outside the reach of naval
power. It is an attitude which she has maintained in the case of
Servia even more clearly than in that of Luxemburg. England holds
herself bound to exert her influence in procuring for the smaller
states of Europe equitable treatment from their more powerful
neighbours. But the duty of insisting upon equitable treatment
falls first upon those Powers whose situation enables them to
support a protest by effective action. Just as Servia is the
special concern of Russia, so Luxemburg must look to France in the
first instance for protection against Germany, to Germany if she is
assailed from the French side. In either case we should hold
ourselves bound to exercise our influence, but not as principals.
Any other course would be impossibly quixotic, and would only have
the effect of destroying our power to help the states within our
reach.</p>
<hr />
<p>The Grand Duchy of Luxemburg was a revival of an ancient state
which had lost its existence during the French Revolution. Although
it was placed under the rule of the King of the Netherlands, a
descendant of its former sovereign, it was not incorporated in his
kingdom, but retained its own identity and gave to its ruler the
secondary title of Grand Duke of Luxemburg. The position it
occupied after 1815 was in some ways anomalous; for lying as it did
between the Meuse and the Rhine, and possessing in the town of
Luxemburg a fortress whose natural strength some competent critics
reckoned as second only to that of Gibraltar among the fortresses
of Europe, it was considered to be an indispensable link in the
chain of defences of Germany against French aggression. Not being
able to trust the Dutch to hold this great fortress against the
French, the Congress of Vienna laid down as a principle that all
land between the Meuse and the Rhine must be held by Prussian
troops on behalf of the newly formed Germanic Confederation. Thus
Luxemburg was held by Prussian troops on behalf of this foreign
confederation, and over this garrison the only right allowed to the
Grand Duke, the sovereign of the country, was that of nominating
the governor.</p>
<p>This strange state of affairs was not modified by the Belgian
Revolution of 1830; for though more than half the Grand Duchy threw
in its lot with Belgium to form the modern province of Belgian
Luxemburg, the Grand Duchy, confined to its modern limits, still
contained the great fortress with its garrison of Prussian troops.
It is not surprising that, under these circumstances, the Grand
Duchy joined the Prussian <i>Zollverein</i>, and so drew nearer to
Germany, in spite of the independent character of its inhabitants,
who have strenuously resisted any attempt at absorption into
Germany. France naturally continued to cast envious eyes upon the
small state with the powerful citadel, but no opportunity presented
itself for reopening the question until 1866.</p>
<p>In that year Napoleon III had anticipated that the war between
Prussia and Italy on one side and Austria and the small German
states on the other would be long and exhausting, and would end in
France imposing peace on the weary combatants with considerable
territorial advantage to herself. His anticipation was entirely
falsified; the war lasted only seven weeks and Prussia emerged
victorious and immensely strengthened by the absorption of several
German states and by the formation of the North German
Confederation under her leadership. This, the first shattering blow
which the French Emperor's diplomatic schemes had received, led him
to demand compensation for the growth of Prussian power, and one of
his proposals was the cession of Luxemburg to France.</p>
<p>This suggestion had some legal plausibility quite apart from the
question of the balance of power. For the Prussian garrison held
Luxemburg in the name of the German Confederation, which had been
destroyed by the war of 1866; and, the authority to which the
garrison owed its existence being gone, it was only logical that
the garrison should go too. After much demur Count Bismarck
acknowledged the justice of the argument (April, 1867), but it did
not by any means follow that the French should therefore take the
place vacated by the Prussians. At the same time the fortress could
not be left in the hands of a weak Power as a temptation for
powerful and unscrupulous neighbours. The question of Luxemburg was
therefore the subject discussed at a Congress held in London in the
following May.</p>
<p>Here the Prussians showed themselves extremely politic and
reasonable. Realizing that, with the advance of artillery, the
great rock-fortress no longer had the military value of earlier
days, they not only raised no objections to the evacuation of
Luxemburg by their troops, but in the Congress it was they who
proposed that the territory of the Grand Duchy should be
neutralized 'under the collective guarantee of the
Powers'.[<a href="#note-6">6</a>] A treaty was therefore drawn up
on May 11, 1867, of which the second article ran as
follows:&mdash;</p>
<p class="blockquote">'The Grand Duchy of Luxemburg, within the
Limits determined by the Act annexed to the Treaties of the 19th
April, 1839, under the Guarantee of the Courts of Great Britain,
Austria, France, Prussia, and Russia, shall henceforth form a
perpetually Neutral State.</p>
<p class="blockquote">'It shall be bound to observe the same
Neutrality towards all other States.</p>
<p class="blockquote">'The High Contracting Parties engage to
respect the principle of Neutrality stipulated by the present
Article.</p>
<p class="blockquote">'That principle is and remains placed under
the sanction of the collective Guarantee of the Powers signing as
Parties to the present Treaty, with the exception of Belgium, which
is itself a Neutral State'.[<a href="#note-7">7</a>]</p>
<p>The third article provided for the demolition of the
fortifications of Luxemburg and its conversion into an open town,
the fourth for its evacuation by the Prussian garrison, and the
fifth forbade the restoration of the fortifications.</p>
<p>Such then was the treaty guaranteeing the neutrality of
Luxemburg, which was proposed, it may be observed, by Prussia
herself; but, until the treaty was broken by the very Power which
had proposed the neutrality, only one incident need be noted in the
history of the country, namely, the part it played in the war of
1870-1. On December 3, 1870, Count Bismarck issued from Versailles
a circular to the Prussian Ambassadors, calling attention to the
fact that both the French and the Luxemburgers had violated the
neutrality of the Grand Duchy, mainly by giving facilities for
French soldiers to return to France. Precautions were taken by the
Prussian Government on the frontier to prevent such abuses
occurring in the future, and as no violation of the neutrality of
Luxemburg was committed by the Prussians, the neutral co-guarantors
were satisfied with the Prussian attitude, and the subject dropped.
At the end of the war, M. Thiers vainly attempted to obtain
Luxemburg as compensation for the loss of Metz.</p>
<p>In accordance with the Family Compact of 1783, the Grand Duchy
passed on the death of the late King of Holland to Prince William
of Nassau, on whose death the present Grand Duchess succeeded to
her father's throne.</p>
<p>There is one point in the Treaty of 1867 which calls for special
comment. The neutrality of the Grand Duchy is 'placed under the
collective guarantee of the Powers signing'. The phrase originally
proposed by Count Bismarck was 'the formal and individual guarantee
of the Powers,' and it was altered at the instance of the English
Foreign Minister, Lord Stanley. The phrase actually adopted was
suggested by the Russian diplomat, Baron Brunnow, and was accepted
both by England and by Prussia. Lord Stanley's objection had been
based upon the fear that England might incur an unlimited liability
to assist Luxemburg single-handed if all other Powers failed to
meet their obligations. In other words, Luxemburg might have been
used as the infallible means of dragging us into every and any war
which might arise between Germany and France. From that danger we
were protected by Lord Stanley's objection; as the case stands the
treaty gives us, in his own words, 'a right to make war, but would
not necessarily impose the obligation,' should Luxemburg be
attacked. To this doctrine a reference will be found in the British
White Paper (No. 148), where Sir Edward Grey informs M. Cambon of
'the doctrine' concerning Luxemburg, 'laid down by Lord Derby and
Lord Clarendon in 1867'. It may also be observed that two of the
co-guarantors of the Treaty of 1867, namely Italy and Holland, have
also not thought it necessary to make the violation of Luxemburg a
<i>casus belli</i>.</p>
<h3>III</h3>
<p>It is evident to all who study closely the map of France that
her eastern frontier falls into two sharply contrasted divisions,
the north-eastern which reaches from the sea to the valley of the
Sambre, and the south-eastern which extends from that river to, and
along the Swiss boundary. The former is flat country, easy for
military operations; the latter is mountainous, intersected with
many deep valleys. After the loss of Alsace-Lorraine, the French
set to work to rectify artificially the strategical weakness of
their frontier; and in a chain of fortresses behind the Vosges
Mountains they erected a rampart which has the reputation of being
impregnable. This is the line Belfort, &Eacute;pinal, Toul, Verdun.
A German attack launched upon this line without violating neutral
territory would have to be frontal, for on the north the line is
covered by the neutral states of Belgium and Luxemburg, while on
the south, although the gap between the Vosges and the Swiss
frontier apparently gives a chance of out-flanking the French
defences, the fortress of Belfort, which was never reduced even in
the war of 1870-1, was considered too formidable an obstacle
against which to launch an invading army. A rapid advance on Paris
was therefore deemed impossible if respect were to be paid to the
neutrality of Belgium and Luxemburg, and it was for this purely
military reason that Germany has to-day violated her promises to
regard the neutrality of these states. This was frankly admitted by
Herr von Jagow to Sir Edward Goschen: 'if they had gone by the more
southern route they could not have hoped, in view of the paucity of
roads and the strength of the fortresses, to have got through
without formidable opposition entailing great loss of
time'.[<a href="#note-8">8</a>]</p>
<p>In the case of Belgium a very easy road was afforded into French
territory up the Valley of the Meuse, past Li&egrave;ge and thence
into France past Namur and through what is known as the Gap of
Namur. A German army could debouch into France through this gap the
more easily inasmuch as the French, relying on the neutrality of
these two states, had not strongly fortified the frontier from the
sea to Maubeuge. Moreover, as the country to the west of the Sambre
was very easy country for manoeuvring and furnished with good roads
and railways, it was reckoned that the formidable French lines to
the south could be turned in this manner, and the German army could
march upon Paris from the north-east.</p>
<p>As to Luxemburg, plainly it could not in such a scheme remain
neutral. It would lie between the two wings of the German army, and
controlling as it did the roads to Brussels, Metz, and
Aix-la-Chapelle, it could not be allowed to cause such
inconvenience as to prevent easy communication between one portion
of the German army and another.</p>
<p>That such a plan was contemplated by the Germans has been for
some years past a matter of common knowledge in England; and it has
been also a matter of common opinion that the attempt to execute
this plan would involve the active resistance of the British
forces, to whom the duty was supposed to have been assigned of
acting on the left flank of the French opposing the entry of the
Germans from Belgian territory. The plea therefore that has been
put forward that the British have now dealt the Germans 'a felon's
blow' can only be put forward by persons who are either ignorant or
heedless of what has been a matter of casual conversation all over
England these last three years; and Sir Edward Grey himself was so
convinced that the German Government knew what the consequences of
a violation of Belgian neutrality would be that he informed Sir
Francis Bertie on July 31st that the 'German Government do not
expect our neutrality'.[<a href="#note-9">9</a>] There has been no
secret about it whatever. It is incredible that the excitement and
surprise of the Imperial Chancellor on the receipt of the ultimatum
of August 4th should have been genuine, seeing that it involves
miscalculation or misinformation entirely incompatible with what we
know of the thoroughness of German methods. At the time of the
Agadir crisis the military situation was the same, and the German
War Office knew quite well what our part would then have been.
Surprise at such action on our part in 1914 is little else than
comedy, and can only have been expressed in order to throw the
blame of German aggression on to the shoulders of Great
Britain.</p>
<p>This argument that Great Britain has taken the aggressive falls
to the ground entirely when it is confronted with the hard facts of
chronology. Far from attacking the Germans, we were so anxious to
keep the peace that we were actually three days late in our
mobilization to join the French on their left wing; and had it not
been for the defence offered by Li&egrave;ge, our scruples would
have gravely imperilled the common cause. For it was not until we
were certain that Germany had committed what was tantamount to an
act of war against us, by invading the neutral state of Belgium,
that we delivered the ultimatum which led to the war.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II</h2>
<center>THE GROWTH OF ALLIANCES AND THE RACE OF ARMAMENTS SINCE
1871</center>
<p>Even at the risk of being tedious it is essential that we should
sketch in outline the events which have produced the present
grouping of belligerent states, and the long-drawn-out preparations
which have equipped them for conflict on this colossal scale. To
understand why Austria-Hungary and Germany have thrown down the
glove to France and Russia, why England has intervened not only as
the protector of Belgium, but also as the friend of France, we must
go back to the situation created by the Franco-German War. Starting
from that point, we must notice in order the formation of the
Triple Alliance between Germany, Austria-Hungary, and Italy, of the
Dual Alliance between France and Russia, of the Anglo-French and
the Anglo-Russian understandings. The Triple Alliance has been the
grand cause of the present situation; not because such a grouping
of the Central European Powers was objectionable, but because it
has inspired over-confidence in the two leading allies; because
they have traded upon the prestige of their league to press their
claims East and West with an intolerable disregard for the law of
nations. Above all it was the threatening attitude of Germany
towards her Western neighbours that drove England forward step by
step in a policy of precautions which, she hoped, would avert a
European conflagration, and which her rivals have attempted to
represent as stages in a Machiavellian design to ruin Germany's
well-being. These precautions, so obviously necessary that they
were continued and expanded by the most pacific Government which
England has seen since Mr. Gladstone's retirement, have taken two
forms: that of diplomatic understandings, and that of naval
preparations. Whichever form they have taken, they have been
adopted in response to definite provocations, and to threats which
it was impossible to overlook. They have been strictly and
jealously measured by the magnitude of the peril immediately in
view. In her diplomacy England has given no blank cheques; in her
armaments she has cut down expenditure to the minimum that, with
reasonable good fortune, might enable her to defend this country
and English sea-borne trade against any probable combination of
hostile Powers.</p>
<p>Let us consider (1) the development of the diplomatic situation
since 1870, (2) the so-called race of armaments since 1886.</p>
<p>The Treaty of Frankfort (May 10, 1871), in which France
submitted to the demands of the new-born German Empire, opened a
fresh era of European diplomacy and international competition. The
German Empire became at once, and has ever since remained, the
predominant Power in Western Europe. The public opinion of this new
Germany has been captured to no small extent by the views of such
aggressive patriots as Treitschke, who openly avowed that 'the
greatness and good of the world is to be found in the predominance
there of German culture, of the German mind, in a word of the
German character'. The school of Treitschke looked for the
establishment of a German world-empire, and held that the essential
preliminary to this scheme would be the overthrow of France and
England. But until 1890, that is to say so long as Prince Bismarck
remained Chancellor, no such ambitious programme was adopted by the
German Government. Bismarck was content to strengthen the position
of the Empire and to sow disunion among her actual or suspected
enemies. In 1872 he brought about a friendly understanding with
Austria and Russia, the other two great Powers of Eastern Europe,
the so-called <i>Dreikaiserb&uuml;ndnis</i>, which was designed to
perpetuate the <i>status quo</i>. But the friendship with Russia
quickly cooled; it received a sharp set-back in 1875, when the Tsar
Alexander II came forward rather ostentatiously to save France from
the alleged hostile designs of Germany; it was certainly not
improved when Bismarck in his turn mediated between Russia and her
opponents at the Congress of Berlin (1878). On the other hand, a
common interest in the Eastern Question drew closer the bonds
between Germany and Austria. The latter felt herself directly
menaced by the Balkan policy of Russia; the former was not prepared
to see her southern neighbour despoiled of territory. Hence in 1879
was initiated that closer union between Germany and Austria which
has been so largely responsible for the present situation. The
Treaty of 1879, which was kept secret until 1887, was purely
defensive in its character; but the terms showed that Russia was
the enemy whom both the contracting Powers chiefly feared. Neither
was bound to active measures unless the other should be attacked by
Russia, or any Power which had Russian support. In 1882 the
alliance of the two great German Powers was joined by Italy&mdash;a
surprising development which can only be explained on the ground of
Italy's feeling that she could not hope for security at home, or
for colonial expansion in the Mediterranean, so long as she
remained in isolation. The Triple Alliance so constituted had a
frail appearance, and it was hardly to be expected that Italy would
receive strong support from partners in comparison with whose
resources her own were insignificant. But the Triple Alliance has
endured to the present day, the most permanent feature of the
diplomatic system of the last thirty-two years. Whether the results
have been commensurate with the sacrifices of sentiment and
ambition which Italy has made, it is for Italy to judge. On the
whole she has been a sleeping partner in the Alliance; its prestige
has served almost exclusively for the promotion of Austrian and
German aims; and one of its results has been to make Austria a
formidable rival of Italy in the Adriatic.</p>
<p>Meanwhile the remaining Great Powers of Europe had continued, as
Prince Bismarck hoped, to pursue their separate paths, though
England was on friendly terms with France and had, equally with
Russia, laboured to avert a second Franco-German War in 1875. After
1882 the English occupation of Egypt constituted for some years a
standing grievance in the eyes of France. The persistent advance of
Russia in Asia had in like manner been a source of growing
apprehension to England since 1868; and, for a long time after the
Treaty of Berlin, English statesmen were on the watch to check the
growth of Russian influence in the Balkans. But common interests of
very different kinds were tending to unite these three Powers, not
in any stable alliance, even for mutual defence, but in a string of
compacts concluded for particular objects.</p>
<p>One of these interests was connected with a feeling that the
policy of the principal partners in the Triple Alliance,
particularly that of Germany, had become incalculable and was only
consistent in periodic outbursts of self-assertiveness, behind
which could be discerned a steady determination to accumulate
armaments which should be strong enough to intimidate any possible
competitor. The growth of this feeling dates from the dismissal of
Prince Bismarck by the present Kaiser. Bismarck had sedulously
courted the friendship of Russia, even after 1882. He entered in
fact into a defensive agreement with Russia against Austria. While
he increased the war strength of the army, he openly announced that
Germany would always stand on the defensive; and he addressed a
warning to the Reichstag against the 'offensive-defensive' policy
which was even then in the air, though it was still far from its
triumph:&mdash;</p>
<p class="blockquote">'If I were to say to you, "We are threatened
by France and Russia; it is better for us to fight at once; an
offensive war is more advantageous to us," and ask for a credit of
a hundred millions, I do not know whether you would grant
it&mdash;I hope not.'[<a href="#note-10">10</a>]</p>
<p>But Bismarck's retirement (1890) left the conduct of German
policy in less cautious hands. The defensive alliance with Russia
was allowed to lapse; friction between the two Powers increased,
and as the result Germany found herself confronted with the Dual
Alliance of France and Russia, which gradually developed, during
the years 1891-6, from a friendly understanding into a formal
contract for mutual defence. There is no doubt that this alliance
afforded France a protection against that unprovoked attack upon
her eastern frontier which she has never ceased to dread since
1875; and it has yet to be proved that she ever abused the new
strength which this alliance gave her.</p>
<p>It is only in the field of colonial expansion that she has shown
aggressive tendencies since 1896; and even here the members of the
Triple Alliance have never shown serious cause for a belief that
France has invaded their lawful spheres of interest. Her advance in
Morocco was permitted by Italy and Spain; her vast dominion in
French West Africa has been recognized by treaties with Germany and
England; in East Africa she has Madagascar, of which her possession
has never been disputed by any European Power; her growing
interests in Indo-China have impinged only upon an English sphere
of interest and were peacefully defined by an Anglo-French
Agreement of 1896. France has been the competitor, to some extent
the successful competitor, of Germany in West Africa, where she
partially envelops the Cameroons and Togoland. But the German
Government has never ventured to state the French colonial methods
as a <i>casus belli</i>. That the German people have viewed with
jealousy the growth of French power in Africa is a notorious fact.
Quite recently, on the eve of the present war, we were formally
given to understand that Germany, in any war with France, might
annex French colonies[<a href="#note-11">11</a>]; and it is easy to
see how such an object would reconcile the divergent policies of
the German military and naval experts.</p>
<p>Up to the eve of the present war Great Britain has consistently
refused to believe that Germany would be mad enough or dishonest
enough to enter on a war of aggression for the dismemberment of
colonial empires. German diplomacy in the past few weeks has rudely
shattered this conviction. But up to the year 1914 the worst which
was generally anticipated was that she would pursue in the future
on a great scale the policy, which she has hitherto pursued on a
small scale, of claiming so-called 'compensations' when other
Powers succeeded in developing their colonial spheres, and of
invoking imaginary 'interests' as a reason why the efforts of
explorers and diplomatists should not be allowed to yield to France
their natural fruits of increased colonial trade. It is not our
business to impugn or to defend the partition of Africa, or the
methods by which it has been brought about. But it is vital to our
subject that we should describe the methods by which Germany has
endeavoured to intimidate France at various stages of the African
question. The trouble arose out of a Moroccan Agreement between
England and France, which was the first definite proof that these
two Powers were drifting into relations closer than that of
ordinary friendship.</p>
<p>In 1904 England and France settled their old quarrel about
Egypt. France recognized the English occupation of Egypt; England,
on her side, promised not to impede the extension of French
influence in Morocco. It was agreed that neither in Egypt nor in
Morocco should there be a political revolution; and that in both
countries the customs tariff should make no distinction between one
nation and another. This compact was accompanied by a settlement of
the old disputes about French fishing rights in Newfoundland, and
of more recent difficulties concerning the frontiers between French
and English possessions in West Africa.[<a href="#note-12">12</a>]
The whole group formed a step in a general policy, on both sides,
of healing local controversies which had little meaning except as
instruments of diplomatic warfare. The agreement regarding Egypt
and Morocco is distinguished from that concerning West Africa and
Newfoundland in so far as it recognizes the possibility of
objections on the part of other Powers. It promised mutual support
in the case of such objections; but not the support of armed force,
only that of diplomatic influence.</p>
<p>At the moment of these agreements Count B&uuml;low told the
Reichstag that Germany had no objection, as her interests were in
no way imperilled by them. Later, however, Germany chose to regard
the Moroccan settlement as an injury or an insult or both. In the
following year the Kaiser made a speech at Tangier (March, 1905) in
which he asserted that he would uphold the important commercial and
industrial interests of Germany in Morocco, and that he would never
allow any other Power to step between him and the free sovereign of
a free country. It was subsequently announced in the German Press
that Germany had no objection to the Anglo-French Agreement in
itself, but objected to not having been consulted before it was
arranged. This complaint was met, on the part of France, by the
retirement of M. Delcass&eacute;, her Minister of Foreign Affairs,
and by her assent to an International Conference regarding Morocco.
The Conference met at Algeciras, and German pretensions were
satisfied by an international Agreement.[<a href="#note-13">13</a>]
It is to be observed that in this Conference the original claims of
Germany were opposed, not only by Russia, from whom she could
hardly expect sympathy, but even by Italy, her own ally. When
Germany had finally assented to the Agreement, her Chancellor, in
flat contradiction with his previous utterance 'that German
interests were in no way imperilled by it', announced that Germany
had been compelled to intervene by her economic interests, by the
prestige of German policy, and by the dignity of the German
Empire.</p>
<p>The plain fact was that Germany, soon after the conclusion of
the Anglo-French agreements, had found herself suddenly delivered
from her preoccupations on the side of Russia, and had seized the
opportunity to assert herself in the West while Russia was involved
in the most critical stage of her struggle with Japan. But this war
came to an end before the Convention of Algeciras had begun; and
Russia, even in the hour of defeat and internal revolutions, was
still too formidable to be overridden, when she ranged herself
beside her Western ally.</p>
<p>Of the part which England played in the Moroccan dispute there
are different versions. What is certain is that she gave France her
diplomatic support. But the German Chancellor officially
acknowledged, when all was over, that England's share in the
Anglo-French Agreement had been perfectly correct, and that Germany
bore England no ill-will for effecting a <i>rapprochement</i> with
France. Still there remained a strong impression, not only in
England and France, that there had been on Germany's part a
deliberate intention to test the strength of the Anglo-French
understanding and, if possible, to show France that England was a
broken reed.</p>
<p>It is not surprising that under these circumstances England has
taken, since 1906, the precaution of freeing herself from any
embarrassments in which she had previously been involved with other
Powers. In 1905 she had shown her goodwill to Russia by exercising
her influence to moderate the terms of the settlement with Japan.
This was a wise step, consonant alike with English
treaty-obligations to Japan and with the interests of European
civilization. It led naturally to an amicable agreement with Russia
(1907) concerning Persia, Afghanistan, and Tibet, the three
countries which touch the northern borders of our Indian Empire. It
cannot be too strongly emphasized that this agreement was of a
local character, exactly as was that with France; that our friendly
understandings with France and with Russia were entirely separate;
and that neither related to the prosecution of a common policy in
Europe; unless indeed the name of a policy could be given to the
precaution, which was from time to time adopted, of permitting
consultations between the French and English military experts. It
was understood that these consultations committed neither country
to a policy of common action.[<a href="#note-14">14</a>] England
was drifting from her old attitude of 'splendid isolation'; but she
had as yet no desire to involve herself, even for defensive
purposes, in such a formal and permanent alliance as that which had
been contracted by Germany, Austria, and Italy.</p>
<p>But her hand was forced by Germany in 1911. Again the question
of Morocco was made to supply a pretext for attacking our
friendship with France. The German occupation of Agadir had, and
could have, only one meaning. It was 'fastening a quarrel on France
on a question that was the subject of a special agreement between
France and us'.[<a href="#note-15">15</a>] The attack failed in its
object. War was averted by the prompt action of the British
Government. Mr. Asquith[<a href="#note-16">16</a>] announced that
Great Britain, in discussing the Moroccan question, would have
regard to British interests, which might be more directly involved
than had hitherto been the case, and also to our treaty obligations
with France. Somewhat later Mr. Asquith announced that if the
negotiations between France and Germany did not reach a
satisfactory settlement, Great Britain would become an active party
to the discussion.[<a href="#note-17">17</a>] The nature of British
interests were appropriately defined by Mr. Lloyd George in a
Guildhall speech as consisting in the peace of the world, the
maintenance of national honour, and the security of international
trade.[<a href="#note-18">18</a>] The last phrase was a significant
reference to the fact that Agadir, though valueless for commercial
purposes, might be invaluable to any Power which desired to molest
the South Atlantic trade routes. No one doubted then, or doubts
to-day, that England stood in 1911 on the brink of a war which she
had done nothing to provoke.</p>
<p>The situation was saved in 1911 by the solidarity of England and
France. Two Powers, which in the past had been separated by a
multitude of prejudices and conflicting ambitions, felt at last
that both were exposed to a common danger of the most serious
character. Hence a new phase in the Anglo-French <i>entente</i>,
which was cemented, not by a treaty, but by the interchange of
letters between the English Secretary for Foreign Affairs (Sir
Edward Grey) and the French Ambassador in London (M. Paul Cambon).
On November 22, 1912, Sir Edward Grey[<a href="#note-19">19</a>]
reminded M. Cambon of a remark which the latter had made, 'that if
either Government had grave reason to expect an unprovoked attack
by a third Power, it might become essential to know whether it
could in that event depend on the armed assistance of the other.'
Sir Edward Grey continued:&mdash;'I agree that if either Government
had grave reason to expect an unprovoked attack by a third Power,
or something that threatened the general peace, it should
immediately discuss with the other whether both Governments should
act together to prevent aggression and to preserve peace, and, if
so, what measures they would be prepared to take in common. If
these measures involved action, the plans of the General Staffs
would at once be taken into consideration, and the Governments
would then decide what effect should be given to them.'</p>
<p>M. Cambon replied on the following day that he was authorized to
accept the arrangement which Sir E. Grey had offered.[<a href=
"#note-20">20</a>]</p>
<p>The agreement, it will be seen, was of an elastic nature.
Neither party was bound to co-operate, even diplomatically, with
the other. The undertaking was to discuss any threatening
situation, and to take common measures if both agreed to the
necessity; there was an admission that the agreement might result
in the conduct of a joint defensive war upon a common plan. Such an
understanding between two sovereign states could be resented only
by a Power which designed to attack one of them without clear
provocation.</p>
<p>The date at which these notes were interchanged is certainly
significant. In November, 1912, the Balkan Allies were advancing on
Constantinople, and already the spoils of the Balkan War were in
dispute. Servia incurred the hostility of Austria-Hungary by
demanding Albania and Adriatic ports; and the Dual Monarchy
announced that it could never accept this arrangement. Behind
Servia Austrian statesmen suspected the influence of Russia; it
was, they said, a scheme for bringing Russia down to a sea which
Austria regarded as her own preserve. Austria mobilized her army,
and a war could hardly have been avoided but for the mediation of
Germany and England. If England had entertained the malignant
designs with which she is credited in some German circles, nothing
would have been easier for her than to fan the flames, and to bring
Russia down upon the Triple Alliance. The notes show how different
from this were the aims of Sir Edward Grey. He evidently foresaw
that a war between Austria and Russia would result in a German
attack upon France. Not content with giving France assurance of
support, he laboured to remove the root of the evil. A congress to
settle the Balkan disputes was held at London in December, 1912;
and it persuaded Servia to accept a reasonable compromise, by which
she obtained commercial access to the Adriatic, but no port. This
for the moment pacified Austria and averted the world-war. To whom
the solution was due we know from the lips of German statesmen. The
German Chancellor subsequently (April 7, 1913) told the
Reichstag:&mdash;</p>
<p class="blockquote">'A state of tension had for months existed
between Austria-Hungary and Russia which was only prevented from
developing into war by the moderation of the Powers.... Europe will
feel grateful to the English Minister of Foreign Affairs for the
extraordinary ability and spirit of conciliation with which he
conducted the discussion of the Ambassadors in London, and which
constantly enabled him to bridge over differences.'</p>
<p>The Chancellor concluded by saying: 'We at any rate shall never
stir up such a war'&mdash;a promise or a prophecy which has been
singularly falsified.</p>
<p>It is no easy matter to understand the line of conduct which
Germany has adopted towards the great Slavonic Power on her flank.
Since Bismarck left the helm, she has sometimes steered in the
direction of subservience, and sometimes has displayed the most
audacious insolence. Periodically, it is to be supposed, her rulers
have felt that in the long run the momentum of a Russian attack
would be irresistible; at other times, particularly after the
Russo-Japanese War, they have treated Russia, as the Elizabethans
treated Spain, as 'a colossus stuffed with clouts.' But rightly or
wrongly they appear to have assumed that sooner or later there must
come a general Armageddon, in which the central feature would be a
duel of the Teuton with the Slav; and in German military circles
there was undoubtedly a conviction that the epic conflict had best
come sooner and not later. How long this idea has influenced German
policy we do not pretend to say. But it has certainly contributed
to her unenviable prominence in the 'race of armaments' which all
thinking men have condemned as an insupportable, tax upon Western
civilization, and which has aggravated all the evils that it was
intended to avert.</p>
<p>The beginning of the evil was perhaps due to France; but, if so,
it was to a France which viewed with just alarm the enormous
strides in population and wealth made by Germany since 1871. The
'Boulanger Law' of 1886 raised the peace footing of the French army
above 500,000 men, at a time when that of Germany was 427,000, and
that of Russia 550,000. Bismarck replied by the comparatively
moderate measure of adding 41,000 to the German peace establishment
for seven years; and it is significant of the difference between
then and now that he only carried his Bill after a dissolution of
one Reichstag and a forcible appeal to its successor.</p>
<p>France must soon have repented of the indiscretion to which she
had been tempted by a military adventurer. With a population
comparatively small and rapidly approaching the stationary phase it
was impossible that she could long maintain such a race. In 1893
Count Caprivi's law, carried like that of Bismarck after a stiff
struggle with the Reichstag, raised the peace establishment to
479,000 men. Count Caprivi at the same time reduced the period of
compulsory service from three years to two; but while this reform
lightened the burden on the individual conscript, it meant a great
increase in the number of those who passed through military
training, and an enormous increase of the war strength. The
Franco-Russian <i>entente</i> of 1896 was a sign that France began
to feel herself beaten in the race for supremacy and reduced to the
defensive. In 1899 the German peace strength was raised to 495,000
for the next six years; in 1905 to 505,000. On the second of these
occasions the German Government justified its policy by pointing
out that the French war strength was still superior to that of
Germany, and would become still stronger if France should change
the period of service from three years to two. The German law was
announced in 1904; it had the natural effect. The French Senate not
only passed the new law early in 1905, but also swept away the
changes which the Lower House had introduced to lighten the burden
of annual training upon territorial reserves. France found her
justification in the Moroccan episode of the previous year.</p>
<p>This was not unreasonable; but since that date France has been
heavily punished for a step which might be taken to indicate that
<i>Revanche</i> was still a feature of her foreign policy. Since
1886 her utmost efforts have only succeeded in raising her peace
establishment to 545,000 (including a body of 28,000 colonial
troops stationed in France), and her total war strength to
4,000,000. In the same period the peace establishment of Germany
was raised to over 800,000, and her total war strength of fully
trained men to something like 5,400,000. It is obvious from these
figures that a policy of isolation has long ceased to be possible
to France; and that an alliance with Russia has been her only
possible method of counterbalancing the numerical superiority of
the German army, which is certainly not less well equipped or
organized than that of France.</p>
<p>This Russian alliance of France has been the only step in her
continental policy which could be challenged as tending to
overthrow the European balance. Undoubtedly it is France's prime
offence in German eyes; and her colonial policy has only been
attacked as a pretext for picking a quarrel and forcing on a
decisive trial of strength before the growth of Russian resources
should have made her ally impregnable.</p>
<p>Let us now look at the German military preparations from a
German point of view. The increases of the last twenty years in
military expenditure and in fighting strength have been openly
discussed in the Reichstag; and the debates have usually run on the
same lines, because the Government up to 1912 pursued a consistent
policy, framed for some years ahead and embodied in an Army Act.
The underlying principle of these Army Acts (1893, 1899, 1905,
1911) was to maintain a fairly constant ratio between the peace
strength and the population. But the war strength was
disproportionately increased by the Caprivi Army Act of 1893, which
reduced the period of compulsory service from three years to two.
The hardly-veiled intention of the German War Staff was to increase
its war resources as rapidly as was consistent with the
long-sufferance of those who served and those who paid the bill. It
was taken as axiomatic that an increasing population ought to be
protected by an increasing army. National defence was of course
alleged as the prime consideration; and if these preparations were
really required by growing danger on the two main frontiers of
Germany, no German could do otherwise than approve the policy, no
foreign Power could feel itself legitimately aggrieved.</p>
<p>Unfortunately it has been a maxim of German policy in recent
years that national independence means the power of taking the
aggressive in any case where national interests or
<i>amour-propre</i> may prompt it. The increase of the German army,
either in numbers or in technical efficiency, seems to be regularly
followed by masterful strokes of diplomacy in which the 'mailed
fist' is plainly shown to other continental Powers. Thus in 1909,
at the close of a quinquennium of military re-equipment, which had
raised her annual army budget from &pound;27,000,000 to
&pound;41,000,000, Germany countenanced the Austrian annexation of
Bosnia and the Herzegovina, and plainly told the authorities at St.
Petersburg that any military action against Austria would bring
Russia into a state of war with Germany. It was a startling step;
<i>radix malorum</i> we may call it, so far as the later
development of the continental situation is concerned. Russia
withdrew from the impending conflict in 1909, but it is improbable
that she has ever forgiven the matter or the manner of the German
ultimatum.</p>
<p>In 1911 followed the episode of Agadir, which was clearly an
attempt to 'force a quarrel on France.' But in 1911 Germany
realized that her military calculations had been insufficient, if
she wished to continue these unamiable diplomatic manners. It was
not a question of self-preservation; it was a question, as the
German Chancellor told the Reichstag, of showing the world that
'Germany was firmly resolved not to be pushed aside.' Hence the
sensational Army Bill of 1912, necessitated, as the Government told
the Reichstag, by the events of 1911. The Russian peril could
hardly be described as imminent. The Prussian Minister of War said
publicly in 1911 that 'there was no Government which either desired
or was seeking to bring about a war with Germany.' Russia had
recently taken steps which, at Berlin, perhaps, were read as signs
of weakness, but elsewhere were hailed as proofs of her desire for
general peace. M. Isvolsky, the supposed champion of Balkan ideals,
had retired from office; his successor, M. Sazonof, had accompanied
the Czar to the Potsdam interview (1910); the outstanding disputes
of Germany and Russia over their Persian interests had been settled
by agreement in 1911.</p>
<p>But the German Army Bill of 1912 was followed by Russia's
intervention in the Balkans to secure for Servia at least
commercial access to the Adriatic. This compromise, ostensibly
promoted and belauded by German statesmanship, only increased the
determination of the German Government to 'hold the ring' in the
Balkans, to claim for Austria the right of settling her own
differences with Servia as she would, and to deny Russia any
interest in the matter. In 1913 came the supreme effort of the
German General Staff: an Army Act for raising the peace strength by
instalments until it reached 870,000, and for the eventual
provision of a war strength of 5,400,000 men. This enormous
increase was recommended 'by the unanimous judgement of the
military authorities' as being 'necessary to secure the future of
Germany.' The Chancellor warned the Reichstag that, although
relations were friendly with Russia, they had to face the
possibilities involved in the Pan-Slavist movement; while in Russia
itself they had to reckon with a marvellous economic development
and an unprecedented reorganization of the army. There was also a
reference to the new law for a return to three years' service which
France was introducing to improve the efficiency of her peace
establishment. But it was obvious that Russia was the main
preoccupation. Germany had forced the pace both in the
aggrandizement of her military strength and in the methods of her
diplomatic intercourse. Suddenly she found herself on the brink of
an abyss. She had gone too far; she had provoked into the
competition of armaments a Power as far superior to Germany in her
reserves of men as Germany thought herself superior to France. It
was not too late for Germany to pause. On her future behaviour
towards other Powers it depended whether the Bill of 1913 should be
taken as an insurance against risks, or as a challenge to all
possible opponents.</p>
<p>The other Powers shaped their policy in accordance with
Germany's example. In France, on March 4, the Supreme Council of
War, having learned the outline of the German programme, decided to
increase the effective fighting force by a return to the rule of
three years' service. Before the German Bill had passed (June 30),
the French Prime Minister announced (May 15) that he would of his
own authority keep with the colours those who were completing their
second year's service in the autumn. The French Army Bill, when
finally passed (July 16), lowered the age limit for commencing
service from twenty-one to twenty, and brought the new rule into
force at once. A few weeks earlier (June 20) Belgium introduced
universal military service in place of her former lenient system.
In Russia a secret session of the Duma was held (July 8) to pass a
new Army Budget, and the term of service was raised from three to
three and a quarter years. Austria alone provided for no great
increase in the numerical strength of her army; but budgeted
(October 30) for extraordinary naval and military expenditure, to
the extent of &pound;28,000,000, to be incurred in the first six
months of 1914. Thus on all sides the alarm was raised, and special
preparations were put in hand, long before the crisis of 1914
actually arrived. It was Germany that had sounded the tocsin; and
it is difficult to believe that some startling <i>coup</i> was not
even then being planned by the leaders of her military party.</p>
<p>We have been told that, whatever the appearance of things might
be, it was Russia who drove Germany to the extraordinary
preparations of 1913; that Germany was arming simply in
self-defence against a Slavonic Crusade. What are the facts?
Economically Russia, as a state, is in a stronger position than the
German Empire. In 1912 we were told that for the past five years
the revenue of Russia had exceeded expenditure by an average sum of
&pound;20,000,000 per annum. The revenue of Russia in 1913 was over
&pound;324,000,000; she has budgeted for &pound;78,000,000 of
military expenditure in 1914, of which some &pound;15,000,000 is
emergency expenditure. The total revenue of the German Empire in
1913 was &pound;184,000,000; she has budgeted for a military
expenditure in 1914 of &pound;60,000,000. To adopt the usual German
tests of comparison, Russia has a population of 173 millions to be
defended on three land-frontiers, while Germany has a population of
65 millions to be defended on only two. The military efforts of
Russia, therefore, have been made on a scale relatively smaller
than those of Germany.</p>
<p>We must, however, add some further considerations which have
been urged by German military critics; the alleged facts we cannot
test, but we state them for what they may be worth. The
reorganization of the Russian army in recent years has resulted, so
we are told, in the grouping of enormously increased forces upon
the western frontier. The western fortresses also have been
equipped on an unparalleled scale. New roads and railways have been
constructed to accelerate the mobilization of the war strength;
and, above all, strategic railways have been pushed towards the
western frontier. Thus, it is argued, Russia has in effect gone
behind the Potsdam Agreement of 1910, by which she withdrew her
armies to a fixed distance behind the Russo-German frontier. We
confess that, in all this, while there may have been cause for
watchfulness on the part of Germany, we can see no valid cause for
war, nothing that of necessity implies more than an intention, on
the part of Russia, not to be brow-beaten in the future as she was
in 1909 and 1912.</p>
<p>These military developments did not escape English notice. They
excited endless speculation about the great war of the future, and
the part which this country might be asked to bear in it. Few,
however, seriously supposed that we should commit ourselves to a
share in the fighting upon land. The problem most usually discussed
in this connexion was that of preparation to resist a sudden
invasion from abroad. Was it possible to avoid compulsory service?
Was the Territorial Force large enough and efficient enough to
defend the country if the Expeditionary Force had gone abroad?
Great Britain was infinitely better equipped for land warfare in
August, 1914, than she had ever been in the nineteenth century. But
her Expeditionary Force was a recent creation, and had been planned
for the defence of India and the Colonies. In practice the country
had clung to the 'Blue Water' policy, of trusting the national
fortunes entirely to the Navy. The orthodox theory was that so long
as the Navy was kept at the 'Two Power' standard, no considerable
invasion of the British Isles was possible.</p>
<p>But from 1898 the programmes of the German Navy Laws constituted
a growing menace to the 'Two Power' standard, which had been laid
down as our official principle in 1889, when France and Russia were
our chief European rivals at sea. That France or Russia would
combine with Germany to challenge our naval supremacy was
improbable; but other states were beginning to build on a larger
scale, and this multiplied the possible number of hostile
combinations. That Germany should wish for a strong fleet was only
natural. It was needed to defend her foreign trade, her colonial
interests, and her own seaports. That Germany should lay down a
definite programme for six years ahead, and that the programme
should become more extensive at each revision, was no necessary
proof of malice. But this country received a shock in 1900, when
the programme of 1898 was unexpectedly and drastically revised, so
that the German Navy was practically doubled. England was at that
moment involved in the South African War, and it was hard to see
against whom the new fleet could be used, if not against England.
This was pointed out from time to time by the Socialist opposition
in the Reichstag. The orthodox official reply was that Germany must
be so strong at sea that the strongest naval Power should not be
able to challenge her with any confidence. But the feeling of the
semi-official Navy League was known to be violently hostile to
England; and it was obvious that the German navy owed its
popularity to the alarmist propaganda of that league.</p>
<p>It was impossible for English statesmen to avoid the suspicion
that, on the sea as on land, the Germans meant by liberty the right
to unlimited self-assertion. Common prudence dictated close
attention to the German Navy Laws; especially as they proved
capable of unexpected acceleration. The 'Two Power' standard, under
the stress of German competition, became increasingly difficult to
maintain, and English Liberals were inclined to denounce it as
wasteful of money. But, when a Liberal Government tried the
experiment of economizing on the Navy (1906-8), there was no
corresponding reduction in the German programme. The German Naval
Law of 1906 raised the amount of the naval estimates by one-third;
and German ministers blandly waved aside as impracticable a
proposal for a mutual limitation of armaments.</p>
<p>In 1909 this country discovered that in capital
ships&mdash;which now began to be considered the decisive factor in
naval warfare&mdash;Germany would actually be the superior by 1914
unless special measures were taken. The British Government was
awakened to the new situation (it arose from the German Naval Law
of 1908), and returned unwillingly to the path of increasing
expenditure. The Prime Minister said that we regretted the race in
naval expenditure and were not animated by anti-German feeling; but
we could not afford to let our supremacy at sea be imperilled,
since our national security depended on it (March 16, 1909). The
'Two Power' standard was dropped, and the Triple Alliance became
the object of special attention at the Admiralty. The First Lord
said on March 13, 1911, that we should make our navy superior to
any foreign navy and to any <i>probable</i> combination which we
might have to meet single-handed. In practice this meant a policy
of developing, in the matter of Dreadnoughts, a superiority of
sixty per cent, over the German navy; this, it was officially
explained in 1912, had been for some years past the actual
Admiralty standard of new construction (Mr. Winston Churchill,
March 18, 1912).</p>
<p>But even this programme had to be stiffened when the year 1912
saw a new German Navy Bill which involved an increased expenditure
of &pound;1,000,000 annually for six years, and had the effect of
putting nearly four-fifths of the German navy in a position of
immediate readiness for war. Earlier in the year the British
Government had announced that, if the German policy of construction
were accelerated, we should add to our programme double the number
which Germany put in hand; but if Germany relaxed her preparations
we should make a fully proportionate reduction. The German Bill
came as an answer to this declaration; and it was followed in this
country by supplementary estimates on naval account, amounting to
nearly a million pounds; and this was announced to be 'the first
and smallest instalment of the extra expenditure entailed by the
new German law.' The new British policy was maintained in 1913 and
in 1914, though in 1913 the First Lord of the Admiralty made a
public offer of a 'naval holiday,' a suspension of new construction
by mutual consent. The Imperial Chancellor responded only by
suggesting that the proposal was entirely unofficial, by asking for
concrete proposals, and by saying that the idea constituted a great
progress; and his naval estimates in 1913 were half a million
higher than those of 1912.</p>
<p>From these facts, viewed in their chronological order, it is
clear that on sea as on land Germany has set the pace. Thirty years
ago the German navy did not enter into England's naval
calculations. For the last six years, if not for a longer period,
it has been the one navy which our Admiralty felt the necessity of
watching from year to year, and indeed from month to month. It is
the first time for more than a hundred years that we have had to
face the problem of 'a powerful homogeneous navy under one
government and concentrated within easy distance of our
shores.'</p>
<p>On German principles we should long ago have adopted the
'offensive-defensive.' We have been at least as seriously menaced
by Germany at sea as Germany has been menaced by Russia upon land.
But we can confidently say that in the period of rivalry our fleet
has never been used as a threat, or turned to the purposes of an
aggressive colonial policy. Rightly or wrongly, we have refused to
make possible intentions a case for an ultimatum. We have held by
the position that only a breach of public law would justify us in
abandoning our efforts for the peace of Europe.</p>

<h3>NOTE</h3>
<p><i>Abstract of Anglo-French Agreement on Morocco</i>.</p>
<p>In April, 1904, England and France concluded an agreement for
the delimitation of their interests on the Mediterranean littoral
of North Africa. The agreement included five secret Articles which
were not published until November, 1911. The purport of the
Articles which were published at the time was as follows. By the
first Article England stated that she had not the intention of
changing the political state of Egypt; and France declared that she
would not impede the action of England in Egypt by demanding that a
term should be fixed for the British occupation or in any other
way. By the second Article France declared that she had not the
intention of changing the political state of Morocco; and England
recognized that it appertained to France, as the Power conterminous
with Morocco, to watch the tranquillity of this country and to
assist it in all administrative, economic, financial, and military
reforms which it required, France promised to respect the customary
and treaty rights of England in Morocco; and by the third Article
England made a corresponding promise to France in respect of Egypt.
By the fourth Article the two Governments undertook to maintain
'the principle of commercial liberty' in Egypt and Morocco, by not
lending themselves in either country to inequality in the
establishment of Customs-duties or of other taxes or of railway
rates. The sixth and seventh Articles were inserted to ensure the
free passage of the Suez Canal and of the Straits of Gibraltar. The
eighth declared that both Governments took into friendly
consideration the interests of Spain in Morocco, and that France
would make some arrangements with the Spanish Monarchy. The ninth
Article declared that each Government would lend its diplomatic
support to the other in executing the clauses relative to Egypt and
Morocco.[<a href="#note-21">21</a>] Of the secret Articles two
(Nos. 3 and 4) related to Spain, defining the territory which she
was to receive 'whenever the Sultan ceases to exercise authority
over it,' and providing that the Anglo-French agreement would hold
good even if Spain declined this arrangement. Article 1 stipulated
that, if either Government found itself constrained, by the force
of circumstances, to modify its policy in respect to Egypt or
Morocco, nevertheless the fourth, sixth, and seventh Articles of
the public declaration would remain intact; that is, each would
under all circumstances maintain the principle of 'commercial
liberty,' and would permit the free passage of the Suez Canal and
the Straits of Gibraltar. In Article 2 England, while disclaiming
any intention to alter the system of Capitulations or the judicial
organization of Egypt, reserved the right to reform the Egyptian
legislative system on the model of other civilized countries; and
France agreed on condition that she should not be impeded from
making similar reforms in Morocco. The fifth Article related to the
Egyptian national debt.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III</h2>
<center>THE DEVELOPMENT OF RUSSIAN POLICY</center>
<p>Until the year 1890 Russia and Germany had been in close touch.
Dynastic connexions united the two imperial houses; and the common
policy of repression of Polish nationality&mdash;the fatal legacy
of the days of Frederic the Great and Catharine II&mdash;united the
two empires. National sentiment in Russia was, however, always
anti-German; and as early as 1885 Balkan affairs began to draw the
Russian Government away from Germany. In 1890 Bismarck fell; and
under William II German policy left the Russian connexion, and in
close touch with Austria embarked on Balkan adventures which ran
counter to Russian aims, while Russia on her side turned to new
allies.</p>
<p>The new direction of Russian policy, which has brought the aims
of the Russian Government into close accord with the desires of
national Slav sentiment, was determined by Balkan conditions.
Bismarck had cherished no Balkan ambitions: he had been content to
play the part of an 'honest broker' at the Congress of Berlin, and
he had spoken of the Bulgarian affair of 1885 as 'not worth the
bones of a Pomeranian grenadier.' William II apparently thought
otherwise. At any rate Germany seems to have conducted, for many
years past, a policy of establishing her influence, along with that
of Austria, through South-Eastern Europe. And it is this policy
which is the <i>fons et origo</i> of the present struggle; for it
is a policy which is not and cannot be tolerated by Russia, so long
as Russia is true to her own Slav blood and to the traditions of
centuries.</p>
<a name="occupation" id="occupation"></a>
<p>After Austria had finally lost Italy, as she did in 1866, she
turned for compensation to the Balkans. If Venetia was lost, it
seemed some recompense when in 1878 Austria occupied Bosnia and the
Herzegovina. Hence she could expand southwards&mdash;ultimately
perhaps to Salonica. Servia, which might have objected, was a
vassal kingdom, the prot&eacute;g&eacute; of Austria, under the
dynasty of the Obrenovitch. As Austria might hope to follow the
line to Salonica,[<a href="#note-22">22</a>] so Germany, before the
end of the nineteenth century, seems to have conceived of a
parallel line of penetration, which would carry her influence
through Constantinople, through Konieh, to Bagdad. She has extended
her political and economic influence among the small Slav states
and in Turkey. In 1898 the King of Roumania (a Hohenzollern by
descent) conceded direct communication through his territories
between Berlin and Constantinople: in 1899 a German company
obtained a concession for the Bagdad railway from Konieh to the
head of the Persian Gulf. In a word, Germany began to stand in the
way of the Russian traditions of ousting the Turk and ruling in
Constantinople: she began to buttress the Turk, to train his army,
to exploit his country, and to seek to oust Russia generally from
South-Eastern Europe.</p>
<p>In 1903 the progress of Austria and Germany received a check. A
blood-stained revolution at Belgrade ousted the pro-Austrian
Obrenovitch, and put in its place the rival family of the
Karageorgevitch. Under the new dynasty Servia escaped from Austrian
tutelage, and became an independent focus of Slav life in close
touch with Russia. The change was illustrated in 1908, when Austria
took advantage of the revolution in Turkey, led by the Young Turks,
to annex formally the occupied territories of Bosnia and the
Herzegovina. Servia, which had hoped to gain these territories,
once a part of the old Servian kingdom, was mortally offended, and
would have gone to war with Austria, if Russia, her champion under
the new dynasty, could only have given her support. But Russia,
still weak after the Japanese war, could not do so; Russia, on the
contrary, had to suffer the humiliation of giving a pledge to the
Austrian Ambassador at St. Petersburg that she would not support
Servia. That humiliation Russia has not forgotten. She has saved
money, she has reorganized her army, she has done everything in her
power to gain security for the future. And now that Austria has
sought utterly to humiliate Servia on the unproved charge
(unproved, in the sense that no legal proof was offered)[<a href=
"#note-23">23</a>] of complicity in the murder of the Archduke
Franz Ferdinand and his wife, Russia has risked war rather than
surrender her protection of a Slav kingdom. Slav sentiment
imperatively demanded action in favour of Servia: no government
could refuse to listen to the demand. The stake for Russia is not
merely the integrity of Servia: it is her prestige among the Slav
peoples, of which she is head; and behind all lies the question
whether South-Eastern Europe shall be under Teutonic control, and
lost to Russian influence.</p>
<p>Germany has not only threatened Slav life in South-Eastern
Europe: she has irritated Slav feeling on her own Eastern frontier.
The vitality and the increase of the Slavs in Eastern Germany has
excited deep German alarm. The German Government has therefore of
late years pursued a policy of repression towards its own Slav
subjects, the Poles, forbidding the use of the Polish language, and
expropriating Polish landowners in order to plant a German garrison
in the East. Teutonism is really alarmed at the superior birth-rate
and physical vigour of the Slavs; but Russia has not loved Teutonic
policy, and there has been an extensive boycott of German goods in
Russian Poland. The promise made by the Tsar, since the beginning
of the war, that he would re-create the old Poland, and give it
autonomy, shows how far Russia has travelled from the days, not so
far distant in point of time, when it was her policy to repress the
Poles in conjunction with Germany; and it has made the breach
between Germany and Russia final and irreparable.</p>
<p>It is thus obvious that Germany is vitally opposed to the great
Slav Empire in South-Eastern Europe and on her own eastern borders.
But why, it may be asked, should Russian policy be linked with
English? Is there any bond of union except the negative bond of
common opposition to Germany? There is. For one thing England and
Russia have sought to pursue a common cause&mdash;that of
international arbitration and of disarmament. If neither has
succeeded, it has been something of a bond between the two that
both have attempted to succeed. But there are other and more vital
factors. England, which in 1854-6 opposed and fought Russia for the
sake of the integrity of Turkey, has no wish to fight Russia for
the sake of a Germanized Turkey. On the contrary, the interest of
England in maintaining independence in the South-East of Europe now
coincides with that of Russia. Above all, the new constitutional
Russia of the Duma is Anglophil.</p>
<p class="blockquote">'The political ideals both of Cadets and
Octobrists were learnt chiefly from England, the study of whose
constitutional history had aroused in Russia an enthusiasm hardly
intelligible to a present-day Englishman. All three Dumas ... were
remarkably friendly to England, and England supplied the staple of
the precedents and parallels for quotation.'[<a href=
"#note-24">24</a>]</p>
<p>In a word, the beginnings of Russian constitutionalism not only
coincided in time with the Anglo-Russian agreement of 1907, but
owed much to the inspiration of England.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV</h2>
<center>CHRONOLOGICAL SKETCH OF THE CRISIS</center>
<p>The following sketch of events from June 28 to August 4, 1914,
is merely intended as an introduction to the analytical and far
more detailed account of the negotiations and declarations of those
days which the reader will find below (<a href="#CH5">Chap. V</a>).
Here we confine the narrative to a plain statement of the
successive stages in the crisis, neither discussing the motives of
the several Powers involved, nor distinguishing the fine shades of
difference in the various proposals which were made by would-be
mediators.</p>
<p>The crisis of 1914 began with an unforeseen development in the
old quarrel of Austria-Hungary and Russia over the Servian
question. On June 28 the Archduke Franz Ferdinand, heir-apparent of
the Austro-Hungarian monarchy, and his wife, the Duchess of
Hohenberg, paid a visit of ceremony to the town of Serajevo, in
Bosnia, the administrative centre of the Austrian provinces of
Bosnia and the Herzegovina. In entering the town, the Archduke and
the Duchess narrowly escaped being killed by a bomb which was
thrown at their carriage. Later in the day they were shot by
assassins armed with Browning pistols. The crime was apparently
planned by political conspirators who resented the Austrian
annexation of Bosnia and the Herzegovina (<i>supra</i>, <a href=
"#occupation">p. 54</a>), and who desired that these provinces
should be united to Servia.</p>
<p>The Austrian Government, having instituted an inquiry, came to
the conclusion that the bombs of the conspirators had been obtained
from a Servian arsenal; that the crime had been planned in
Belgrade, the Servian capital, with the help of a Servian
staff-officer who provided the pistols; that the criminals and
their weapons had been conveyed from Servia into Bosnia by officers
of Servian frontier-posts and by Servian customs-officials. At the
moment the Austrian Government published no proof of these
conclusions,[<a href="#note-25">25</a>] but, on July 23, forwarded
them to the Servian Government in a formal note containing certain
demands which, it was intimated, must be satisfactorily answered by
Servia within forty-eight hours.[<a href="#note-26">26</a>] This
ultimatum included a form of apology to be published on a specified
date by the Servian Government, and ten engagements which the
Servian Government were to give the Austro-Hungarian Government.
The extraordinary nature of some of these engagements is explained
in the <a href="#CH5">next chapter</a> (pp. 103-7).</p>
<p>On July 24 this note was communicated by Austria-Hungary to the
other Powers of Europe,[<a href="#note-27">27</a>] and on July 25
it was published in a German paper, the <i>Norddeutsche Allgemeine
Zeitung</i>. It was therefore intended to be a public warning to
Servia. On July 24 the German Government told the Powers that it
approved the Austrian note, as being necessitated by the
'Great-Servian' propaganda, which aimed at the incorporation in the
Servian monarchy of the southern Slav provinces belonging to
Austria-Hungary; that Austria, if she wished to remain a Great
Power, could not avoid pressing the demands contained in the note,
even, if necessary, by military measures; and that the question was
one which concerned no Powers except Austria-Hungary and
Servia.[<a href="#note-28">28</a>]</p>
<p>Russia did not agree that the Austrian note was directed against
Servia alone. On July 24 the Russian Minister of Foreign Affairs
told the British Ambassador at St. Petersburg that Austria's
conduct was provocative and immoral; that some of her demands were
impossible of acceptance; that Austria would never have taken such
action unless Germany had first been consulted; that if Austria
began military measures against Servia, Russia would probably
mobilize. The Russian Minister hoped that England would proclaim
its solidarity with France and Russia on the subject of the
Austrian note; doubtless Servia could accept some of the Austrian
demands.[<a href="#note-29">29</a>] To the Austro-Hungarian
Government the Russian Minister sent a message, on the same day,
July 24, that the time-limit allowed to Servia for her reply was
quite insufficient, if the Powers were to help in smoothing the
situation; and he urged that Austria-Hungary should publish the
proofs of the charges against Servia.[<a href="#note-30">30</a>] On
July 25 Russia told England[<a href="#note-31">31</a>] that Servia
would punish those proved to be guilty, but would not accept all
the demands of Austria; that no independent state could do so. If
Servia appealed to arbitration, as seemed possible, Russia was, she
said, prepared to leave the arbitration in the hands of England,
France, Germany, and Italy&mdash;the four Powers whom Sir Edward
Grey had suggested as possible mediators.</p>
<p>On the day on which Russia made this suggestion, July 25, the
Servian Government replied to the Austrian note, conceding part of
the Austrian demands, and announcing its readiness to accept, on
the other points, the arbitration of the Hague Tribunal or of the
Great Powers. The Austrian Government found the Servian note
unsatisfactory, and criticized its details in an official
memorandum.[<a href="#note-32">32</a>] The Austro-Hungarian
Minister left Belgrade on July 25; on July 26 a part of the
Austro-Hungarian army was mobilized; and on July 28 Austria-Hungary
declared war on Servia.</p>
<p>Sir Edward Grey had from the first declined to 'announce
England's solidarity' with Russia and France on the Servian
question. On and after July 26 he was taking active steps to bring
about the mediation, between Austria-Hungary and Servia, of four
Powers (Italy, Germany, France, England). To this mediation Russia
had already agreed, July 25; and Italy and France were ready to
co-operate with England.[<a href="#note-33">33</a>] Germany,
however, made difficulties on the ground that anything like formal
intervention would be impracticable, unless both Austria and Russia
consented to it.[<a href="#note-34">34</a>] Russia had already
(July 25) prepared the ukase ordering mobilization,[<a href=
"#note-35">35</a>] but had not yet issued it; on July 27 the
Russian Foreign Minister announced his readiness to make the
Servian question the subject of direct conversations with
Vienna.[<a href="#note-36">36</a>] This offer was at first declined
by the Austro-Hungarian Government, but subsequently accepted; and
conversations were actually in progress between the representatives
of the two Powers as late as August 1.[<a href=
"#note-37">37</a>]</p>
<p>No doubt the hesitation of Austria was due to the fact that, on
July 28, the Russian Government warned Germany of the mobilization
of the southern military districts of Russia, to be publicly
proclaimed on July 29.[<a href="#note-38">38</a>] Austria replied
to this intimation by offering assurances that she would respect
the integrity and independence of Servia;[<a href=
"#note-39">39</a>] these assurances, considered inadequate by the
Russian Government, seem to have been the subject of the last
conversations between Russia and Austria-Hungary.</p>
<p>Russia persisted that Germany was the real obstacle to a
friendly settlement; and this conviction was not affected by the
appeals for peace which the Kaiser telegraphed to the Tsar on July
28, July 29, and July 31.[<a href="#note-40">40</a>] On July 29
Germany told England that the Russian mobilization was alarming,
and that France was also making military preparations;[<a href=
"#note-41">41</a>] at the same time Germany threatened to proclaim
'imminent state of war' (<i>drohende Kriegsgefahr</i>) as a counter
measure to the French preparations;[<a href="#note-42">42</a>]
German military preparations, by July 30, had in fact gone far
beyond the preliminary stage which she thus indicated.[<a href=
"#note-43">43</a>] Germany had already warned England, France, and
Russia that, if Russia mobilized, this would mean German
mobilization against both France and Russia.[<a href=
"#note-44">44</a>] But on July 27, Russia had explained that her
mobilization would in no sense be directed against Germany, and
would only take place if Austrian forces crossed the Servian
frontier.[<a href="#note-45">45</a>] On July 29, the day on which
Russia actually mobilized the southern districts, Russia once more
asked Germany to participate in the 'quadruple conference' now
proposed by England, for the purpose of mediating between Austria
and Servia. This proposal was declined by the German Ambassador at
St. Petersburg.[<a href="#note-46">46</a>] Germany in fact
believed, or professed to believe, that the Russian mobilization,
though not proclaimed, was already far advanced.[<a href=
"#note-47">47</a>]</p>
<p>On July 30 Austria, although her conversations with Russia were
still in progress, began the bombardment of Belgrade. The next day,
July 31, Russia ordered general mobilization; on August 1 France
and Germany each took the like step; Germany presented an ultimatum
to Russia, demanding that Russian mobilization should cease, and
another ultimatum to France asking what course she would take in
the event of war between Germany and Russia.</p>
<p>Before these decisive steps of July 30-August 1, and while Sir
Edward Grey was still engaged in efforts of mediation, Germany made
overtures to England, with the object of securing England's
neutrality in the event of a war between Germany and France. On
July 29 Germany offered, as the price of English neutrality, to
give assurances that, if victorious, she would make no territorial
acquisitions at the expense of France; but refused to give a
similar assurance respecting French colonies, or to promise to
respect Belgian neutrality.[<a href="#note-48">48</a>] These
proposals were refused by England on July 30.[<a href=
"#note-49">49</a>] On August 1 the German Ambassador unofficially
asked England to remain neutral on condition that Germany would not
violate Belgian neutrality. Sir Edward Grey replied that England's
hands were still free, and that he could not promise neutrality on
that condition alone.[<a href="#note-50">50</a>]</p>
<p>Meanwhile, on July 30, Sir Edward Grey was told by France that
she would not remain neutral in a war between Germany and
Russia.[<a href="#note-51">51</a>] On July 31 the English Cabinet,
being asked by France to declare definitely on her side, replied
that England could give no pledge at present.[<a href=
"#note-52">52</a>] On the same day England asked France and Germany
to engage to respect Belgian neutrality. France assented, Germany
evaded giving a reply.[<a href="#note-53">53</a>] But, on August 2,
German forces entered the neutral state of Luxemburg; and England
promised to defend the French coasts and shipping if attacked by
the German fleet in the Channel, or through the North Sea.[<a href=
"#note-54">54</a>] On August 4 the King of the Belgians telegraphed
to King George announcing that Germany had demanded passage for her
troops through Belgian territory, and appealing to England for
help.[<a href="#note-55">55</a>] On the same day, August 4, England
sent an ultimatum to Germany asking for assurance, before midnight,
that Germany would respect Belgian neutrality.[<a href=
"#note-56">56</a>] This demand was taken at Berlin as equivalent to
a declaration of war by England against Germany.</p>

<h3>I</h3>
<center><i>Germany's attitude to Austria and Russia</i>.</center>
<p>From the very beginning of the conversations between the Powers
on the assassination of the Archduke Franz Ferdinand at Serajevo,
and on the Austrian note to Servia, the German Government took up
the attitude that it was a 'matter for settlement between Servia
and Austria alone.'[<a href="#note-57">57</a>] Subsequently in
their White Book they endeavoured to show that the Servian
agitation was part of Russian propagandism.[<a href=
"#note-58">58</a>] In the negotiations, the cardinal point of their
observations is that Russia is not to interfere in this matter,
although M. Paul Cambon pointed out that 'Russia would be compelled
by her public opinion to take action as soon as Austria attacked
Servia'.[<a href="#note-59">59</a>]</p>
<p>After the presentation of the Austrian note to Servia, Germany
continued to maintain the position that the crisis could be
localized, and to reject Sir Horace Rumbold's suggestion that 'in
taking military action in Servia, Austria would dangerously excite
public opinion in Russia'.[<a href="#note-60">60</a>]</p>
<p>At Vienna Sir Maurice de Bunsen, the British Ambassador, was
very frankly told by the German Ambassador that Germany was
shielding Austria in the Servian business:&mdash;</p>
<p class="blockquote">'As for Germany, she knew very well what she
was about in backing up Austria-Hungary in this matter.... Servian
concessions were all a sham. Servia proved that she well knew that
they were insufficient to satisfy the legitimate demands of
Austria-Hungary by the fact that before making her offer she had
ordered mobilization and retirement of Government from
Belgrade.'[<a href="#note-61">61</a>]</p>
<p>M. Sazonof, the Russian Foreign Minister, seems to have divined
this policy of Germany pretty soon:&mdash;</p>
<p class="blockquote">'My interviews with the German Ambassador
confirm my impression that Germany is, if anything, in favour of
the uncompromising attitude adopted by Austria. The Berlin Cabinet,
who could have prevented the whole of this crisis developing,
appear to be exercising no influence upon their ally.... There is
no doubt that the key of the situation is to be found at
Berlin.'[<a href="#note-62">62</a>]</p>
<p>When at the beginning of August the crisis had led to war, it is
interesting to observe the opinions expressed by high and
well-informed officials about German diplomacy. M. Sazonof summed
up his opinion thus:&mdash;</p>
<p class="blockquote">'The policy of Austria had throughout been
tortuous and immoral, and she thought she could treat Russia with
defiance, secure in the support of her German ally. Similarly the
policy of Germany had been an equivocal and double-faced policy,
and it mattered little whether the German Government knew or did
not know the terms of the Austrian ultimatum; what mattered was
that her intervention with the Austrian Government had been
postponed until the moment had passed when its influence would have
been felt. Germany was unfortunate in her representatives in Vienna
and St. Petersburg; the former was a violent Russophobe who had
urged Austria on, the latter had reported to his Government that
Russia would never go to war.'[<a href="#note-63">63</a>]</p>
<p>And Sir Maurice de Bunsen on the same day wrote that he agreed
with his Russian colleague that</p>
<p class="blockquote">'the German Ambassador at Vienna desired war
from the first, and his strong personal bias probably coloured his
action here. The Russian Ambassador is convinced that the German
Government also desired war from the first.'[<a href=
"#note-64">64</a>]</p>
<p>Sir Maurice does not actually endorse this opinion concerning
the attitude of the German Government, but there can be no doubt
that this general attitude was most pernicious to the cause of
European peace, and that if the German Government had desired war
they could scarcely have acted more efficiently towards that end.
No diplomatic pressure was put upon Vienna, which under the aegis
of Berlin was allowed to go to any lengths against Servia. Over and
over again the German diplomats were told that Russia was deeply
interested in Servia, but they would not listen. As late as July
28th the German Chancellor himself refused 'to discuss the Servian
note', adding that 'Austria's standpoint, and in this he agreed,
was that her quarrel with Servia was a purely Austrian concern with
which Russia had nothing to do'.[<a href="#note-65">65</a>] Next
day the German Ambassador at Vienna was continuing 'to feign
surprise that Servian affairs could be of such interest to
Russia'.[<a href="#note-66">66</a>] But in their White Book, in
order to blacken the character of Russia, the Germans remark that
they 'were perfectly aware that a possible warlike attitude of
Austria-Hungary against Servia might bring Russia into the
field'.[<a href="#note-67">67</a>] Both stories cannot be true: the
German Government have, not for the last time in the history of
these negotiations, to choose between ineptitude and guilt; the
ineptitude of not recognizing an obvious fact, and the guilt of
deliberately allowing Austria to act in such a way that Russia was
bound to come into the field.</p>
<a name="failedproposal" id="failedproposal"></a>
<p>When Austria presented her ultimatum, Sir Edward Grey did all he
could to obtain the good offices of Russia for a conciliatory reply
by Servia, and to persuade the German Government to use influence
with Austria so that she should take a friendly attitude to Servia.
On the day of the presentation of the Austrian note he proposed to
Prince Lichnowsky, the German Ambassador, the co-operation of the
four Powers, Germany, France, Italy, and Great Britain, in favour
of moderation at Vienna and St. Petersburg, and when the Austrians
rejected the Servian reply he took the important step of proposing
that the French, Italian, and German Ambassadors should meet him in
conference immediately 'for the purpose of discovering an issue
which would prevent complications'.[<a href="#note-68">68</a>] The
proposal was accepted with alacrity by the French and Italian
Governments. The German Secretary for Foreign Affairs, Herr von
Jagow, on the other hand, was unable or unwilling to understand the
proposal, and Sir Edward Goschen seems to have been unable to
impress its real character upon the Government of Berlin. For Herr
von Jagow, on receipt of the proposal, informed the British
Ambassador, Sir Edward Goschen, that the conference suggested</p>
<p class="blockquote">'would practically amount to a court of
arbitration and could not in his opinion be called together except
at the request of Austria and Russia. He could not therefore fall
in with it.'</p>
<p>Sir Edward Goschen not unnaturally pointed out that</p>
<p class="blockquote">'the idea had nothing to do with arbitration,
but meant that representatives of the four nations not directly
interested should discuss and suggest means for avoiding a
dangerous situation'.[<a href="#note-69">69</a>]</p>
<p>Herr von Jagow spoke in the same sense to the French and Italian
Ambassadors, who discussed the matter with their British colleague.
Some doubt seems to have arisen in their minds as to the sincerity
of the German Secretary of State's loudly expressed desire for
peace; but, giving him the benefit of the doubt, they concluded
that the objection must be to the 'form of the proposal'.
'Perhaps', added Sir Edward Goschen, 'he himself could be induced
to suggest lines on which he would find it possible to work with
us.'[<a href="#note-70">70</a>] The next day the same idea was
pressed by Sir Edward Grey upon Prince Lichnowsky:&mdash;</p>
<p class="blockquote">'The whole idea of mediation or mediating
influence was ready to be put into operation by any method that
Germany could suggest if mine was not acceptable.'[<a href=
"#note-71">71</a>]</p>
<p>But owing to German dilatoriness in this matter, events had by
then gone so far that the very gravest questions had arisen for
this country.</p>
<p>With the refusal of the German Government to propose a form of
mediation acceptable to themselves before graver events had
occurred, the first period of the negotiation comes to an end. The
responsibility of rejecting a conference, which, by staving off the
evil day, might have preserved the peace of Europe, falls solely on
the shoulders of Germany. The reasons advanced by Herr von Jagow
were erroneous, and though Dr. von Bethmann-Hollweg, the Imperial
Chancellor, was more conciliatory and sympathetic, it may be noted
that the German White Book[<a href="#note-72">72</a>] continues to
misrepresent Sir Edward Grey's proposal as a conference on the
particular question of the Austro-Servian dispute, and not on the
general situation of Europe.</p>
<p>In the period that follows come spasmodic attempts at
negotiation by direct conversations between the parties concerned,
with no advantage, but rather with the growth of mutual suspicion.
Down to August 1st both Sir Edward Grey and M. Sazonof were busy
trying to find some formula which might be accepted as a basis for
postponing hostilities between the Great Powers. And here it may be
well to point out that Prince Lichnowsky seems to have been left in
the dark by his chiefs. On July 24th, the day after the Austrian
note was presented, he was so little acquainted with the true state
of affairs, that speaking privately he told Sir Edward Grey 'that a
reply favourable on some points must be sent at once by Servia, so
that an excuse against immediate action might be afforded to
Austria'.[<a href="#note-73">73</a>] And in the matter of the
conference, on the very day that Herr von Jagow was making his
excuses against entering the proposed conference, Prince Lichnowsky
informed Sir Edward Grey, that the German Government accepted in
principle mediation between Austria and Russia by the four Powers,
reserving, of course, their right as an ally to help Austria if
attacked.[<a href="#note-74">74</a>] The mutual incompatibility of
the two voices of Germany was pointed out from Rome, where the
Marquis di San Giuliano, the Italian Foreign Minister, attempted a
reconciliation between them, on information received from Berlin,
that 'the difficulty was rather the "conference" than the
principle'.[<a href="#note-75">75</a>] But we may ask whether Herr
von Jagow's reply to Sir Edward Goschen does not really show that
the whole principle of a conference was objected to, seeing that he
said that such a 'conference was not practicable', and that 'it
would be best to await the outcome of the exchange of views between
the Austrian and Russian Governments'.[<a href="#note-76">76</a>]
But, if it was not the principle that was objected to, but only the
form, where are we? We can do nothing else but assume that the
German Government objected to the terms employed by Sir Edward
Grey, and that for the sake of a mere quibble they wasted time
until other events made the catastrophe inevitable. Impartiality
will have to judge whether such action was deliberate or not;
whether in this case also it is crime or folly which has to be laid
at the door of the German Government.</p>
<p>The proposed conference having been rejected by Germany, an
attempt was then made by several Powers to invite Austria to
suspend military action. Although Count Mensdorff, the Austrian
Ambassador in London, had made on July 25th a distinction between
military preparations and military operations, and had urged that
his Government had only the former then in view, it was reported
two days later from Rome that there were great doubts 'whether
Germany would be willing to invite Austria to suspend military
action pending the conference'. Even if she had been willing to do
so, it is very doubtful whether, in view of the Austrian
declaration of war against Servia on July 28th, and the
simultaneous Austrian decree for general mobilization, the position
of Europe could have been improved, for on July 29th that
declaration was followed by news of the Russian mobilization of the
southern districts of Odessa, Kiev, Moscow, and Kazan.[<a href=
"#note-77">77</a>]</p>
<p>Now the German Secretary of State had argued that 'if Russia
mobilized against Germany, latter would have to follow suit'. On
being asked what he meant by 'mobilizing against Germany', he said
that</p>
<p class="blockquote">'if Russia mobilized in the South, Germany
would not mobilize, but if she mobilized in the north, Germany
would have to do so too, and Russian system of mobilization was so
complicated that it might be difficult exactly to locate her
mobilization. Germany would therefore have to be very careful not
to be taken by surprise.'[<a href="#note-78">78</a>]</p>
<p>This was on July 27th, and it cannot be said to have been
unreasonable. But when on July 29th Russia mobilized the southern
districts no grounds for German mobilization had yet been provided.
No secret was made about this mobilization by the Russian
Ambassador at Berlin,[<a href="#note-79">79</a>] but it is perhaps
as well to point out here the remark made by Sir George Buchanan,
the British Ambassador at St. Petersburg, about the language used
by his German colleague concerning the mobilization of the four
southern districts: 'He accused the Russian Government of
endangering the peace of Europe by their mobilization, and said,
when I referred to all that had recently been done by Austria, that
he could not discuss such matters.'[<a href="#note-80">80</a>] It
would perhaps be rash to assume that the German Ambassador, Count
Pourtal&egrave;s, used such language to his home Government, for
there is no evidence of it in the German White Book. What
dispatches appear there from the German Embassy at St. Petersburg
are refreshingly honest. The military attach&eacute; says, 'I deem
it certain that mobilization has been ordered for Kiev and Odessa'.
He adds: 'it is doubtful at Warsaw and Moscow, and improbable
elsewhere'.[<a href="#note-81">81</a>]</p>
<p>There was therefore, according to the evidence produced by the
Germans themselves, no mobilization 'against Germany'. The only
thing that looks at all like hostile action is contained in the
news sent by the Imperial German Consul at Kovno on July 27th, that
a 'state of war' (<i>Kriegszustand</i>) had been proclaimed in that
district. But this is a very different thing from mobilization; it
was almost bound to follow in the northern provinces of the Empire
as the result of mobilization elsewhere. At any rate the Consul at
Kovno announced it on July 27th before any Russian mobilization at
all had taken place, and the fact that Germany did not instantly
mobilize shows that at the end of July that Government did not
consider <i>Kriegszustand</i> in Kovno to be equivalent to
'mobilization against Germany'.</p>
<p>Opinion in Berlin seems to have been that Russia would not make
war. Perhaps there was no real fear that Russia would take an
aggressive attitude, for many people believed that 'Russia neither
wanted, nor was in a position to make war'.[<a href=
"#note-82">82</a>] This attitude of mind was known and deplored in
Rome, where the Marquis di San Giuliano said 'there seemed to be a
difficulty in making Germany believe that Russia was in
earnest'.[<a href="#note-83">83</a>] Such an opinion seems to have
been shared by Count Pourtal&ecirc;s, who on July 29 reported that
the German Government were willing to guarantee that Servian
integrity would be respected by Austria. This was held to be
insufficient, as Servia might thus become an Austrian vassal, and
there would be a revolution in Russia if she were to tolerate such
a state of affairs. The next day the Russian Minister for Foreign
Affairs told the British and French Ambassadors 'that absolute
proof was in the possession of the Russian Government that Germany
was making military and naval preparations against
Russia&mdash;more particularly in the direction of the Gulf of
Finland'.[<a href="#note-84">84</a>]</p>
<p>After this, is it difficult to see how German statesmen regarded
the situation? Russia, in their eyes, was playing a game of bluff,
and strong measures against her were in the interest of Germany.
But, though under no illusion as to German preparations, M. Sazonof
offered on July 30 to stop all military preparations if Austria
'would eliminate from her ultimatum to Servia points which violate
the principle of the sovereignty of Servia'.[<a href=
"#note-85">85</a>] 'Preparations for general mobilization will be
proceeded with if this proposal is rejected by Austria,' wrote Sir
George Buchanan.[<a href="#note-86">86</a>] The next day he
reported to Sir Edward Grey that all attempts to obtain the consent
of Austria to mediation had failed, and that she was moving troops
against Russia as well as against Servia.[<a href=
"#note-87">87</a>]</p>
<p>Face to face therefore with war against another Power, Russia
ordered a general mobilization.[<a href="#note-88">88</a>] This was
answered on the same day by a proclamation of <i>Kriegsgefahr</i>
at Berlin, 'as it can only be against Germany that Russian general
mobilization is directed'.[<a href="#note-89">89</a>]</p>
<p>Thus on Friday, July 31st, the situation had come to be this,
that Russia, feeling herself threatened by the military
preparations of Austria and Germany, decided to issue orders for a
general mobilization.[<a href="#note-90">90</a>] Meanwhile Sir
Edward Grey still clung to the hope that mediation with a view to
safeguarding Austrian interests as against Servia might yet be
accepted.[<a href="#note-91">91</a>] But his efforts were useless,
for Germany had launched an ultimatum (July 31) to Russia,
demanding demobilization. As Sir Edward Goschen pointed out, the
demand was made 'even more difficult for Russia to accept by asking
them to demobilize in the south as well'.[<a href=
"#note-92">92</a>] The only explanation actually vouchsafed was
that this had been asked to prevent Russia pleading that all her
mobilization was only directed against Austria. Such a quibble,
when such interests are at stake, seems to call for severe
comment.</p>
<p>War between the three empires seemed now inevitable, for though
the Emperor of Russia and the German Emperor had exchanged
telegrams each imploring the other to find a way out of the
difficulty, and each saying that matters had gone so far that
neither could grant the other's demands,[<a href="#note-93">93</a>]
the officials at Berlin were now taking up the position that
'Russia's mobilization had spoilt everything'.[<a href=
"#note-94">94</a>] This attitude is as inexplicable as it proved
disastrous. For it appears that on July 31 Austria and Russia were
ready to resume conversations. The Austrians, apparently alarmed at
the prospect of a general war, were ready to discuss the substance
of the Austrian ultimatum to Servia, and Russia announced that
under certain conditions 'she would undertake to preserve her
waiting attitude'.[<a href="#note-95">95</a>] Having issued her
ultimatum to Russia, Germany naturally mobilized, but what kind of
diplomacy is this in which, with the principals both ready to
negotiate, a third party issues an ultimatum couched in such terms
that a proud country can give but one answer?</p>
<p>The sequence of events seems to be as follows. Austria mobilized
against Servia. Russia, rightly or wrongly, took this as a threat
to herself, and mobilized all her southern forces against Austria.
Then Germany threatened to mobilize unless Russia ceased her
military preparations&mdash;an inexcusable step, which increased
Russia's apprehensions of a general war, and made a general Russian
mobilization inevitable.[<a href="#note-96">96</a>] If Russia was
the first to mobilize, she took this step in consequence of German
threats. We repeat that in spite of the three empires taking this
action, discussion was still possible between Russia and
Austria,[<a href="#note-97">97</a>] and might have had good
results. In fact, the situation was not irretrievable, if Germany
had not rendered it so by issuing her ultimatum to Russia. Once
again we may ask, was this crime or folly?</p>
<h3>II</h3>
<center><i>Germany's attitude to France.</i></center>
<p>We must now turn our eyes to the West of Europe, and observe the
diplomacy of Germany with regard to France and Great Britain. On
the 27th of July we are told that the German Government received
'the first intimation concerning the preparatory measures taken by
France: the 14th Corps discontinued the manoeuvres and returned to
its garrison'.[<a href="#note-98">98</a>] Will it be believed that,
except for the assertion 'of rapidly progressing preparations of
France, both on water and on land',[<a href="#note-99">99</a>] this
is the only shred of evidence that the Germans have produced to
prove the aggressive intentions of France? And it may be worth
while to point out that on July 29, when the German White Book says
that Berlin heard of the 'rapidly progressing preparations of
France', the French Ambassador at Berlin informed the Secretary of
State that 'they had done nothing more than the German Government
had done, namely, recalled the officers on leave'.[<a href=
"#note-100">100</a>]</p>
<p>The very next day the French Government had 'reliable
information that the German troops are concentrated round
Thionville and Metz ready for war',[<a href="#note-101">101</a>]
and before July 30th German patrols twice penetrated into French
territory.[<a href="#note-102">102</a>] With great forbearance the
French Government withdrew its troops ten kilometres from the
frontier; and, although German reservists had been recalled from
abroad 'by tens of thousands', the French Government had not called
out a single reservist. Well might the French Minister for Foreign
Affairs say 'Germany has done it'.[<a href="#note-103">103</a>]</p>
<p>Having thus invaded France before July 30th, the German
Government presented an ultimatum (July 31) demanding what were the
French intentions, and on August 1st the French Government replied
that it would consult its own interests.[<a href=
"#note-104">104</a>]</p>
<a name="ch5sec3" id="ch5sec3"></a>
<h3>III</h3>
<center><i>The Question of British Neutrality</i>.</center>
<p>Even then, nothing had happened to bring this country into the
quarrel. If Germany were making war primarily on Russia, and France
were only involved as the auxiliary of Russia, Germany would have
acted rapidly against Russia, and would have stood on the defensive
against France; and England would not have been dragged into
war.[<a href="#note-105">105</a>] The question of British
neutrality first appears in the British White Book on July 25th,
when Sir Edward Grey, in a note to Sir George Buchanan, said: 'if
war does take place, the development of other issues may draw us
into it, and I am therefore anxious to prevent it'.[<a href=
"#note-106">106</a>] Two days later he wrote again:&mdash;</p>
<p class="blockquote">'I have been told by the Russian Ambassador
that in German and Austrian circles impression prevails that in any
event we would stand aside ... This impression ought, as I have
pointed out, to be dispelled by the orders we have given to the
First Fleet ... not to disperse for manoeuvre leave. But ... my
reference to it must not be taken to mean that anything more than
diplomatic action was promised.'[<a href="#note-107">107</a>]</p>
<p>On the 29th the question of our neutrality was seriously
discussed at both the Courts of St. James and Berlin independently.
Sir Edward Grey, in an interview with Prince Lichnowsky, told him
'he did not wish the Ambassador to be misled ... into thinking we
should stand aside'. Developing this, Sir Edward Grey solemnly
warned the German Ambassador that</p>
<p class="blockquote">'there was no question of our intervening if
Germany was not involved, or even if France was not involved, but
if the issue did become such that we thought British interests
required us to intervene, we must intervene at once, and the
decision would have to be very rapid.... But ... I did not wish to
be open to any reproach from him that the friendly tone of all our
conversations had misled him or his Government into supposing that
we should not take action.'[<a href="#note-108">108</a>]</p>
<p>Before the news of this had reached Berlin the Imperial
Chancellor had made his notorious 'bid for British neutrality' on
July 29:&mdash;</p>
<p class="blockquote">'He said it was clear, so far as he was able
to judge the main principle which governed British policy, that
Great Britain would never stand by and allow France to be crushed
in any conflict there might be. That, however, was not the object
at which Germany aimed. Provided that neutrality of Great Britain
were certain, every assurance would be given to the British
Government that the Imperial Government aimed at no territorial
acquisitions at the expense of France, should they prove victorious
in any war that might ensue.</p>
<p class="blockquote">'I questioned his Excellency about the French
colonies, and he said he was unable to give a similar undertaking
in that respect. As regards Holland ... so long as Germany's
adversaries respected the integrity and neutrality of the
Netherlands, Germany was ready to give His Majesty's Government an
assurance that she would do likewise. It depended on the action of
France what operations Germany might be forced to enter upon in
Belgium, but when the war was over, Belgian integrity would be
respected if she had not sided against Germany.'[<a href=
"#note-109">109</a>]</p>
<p>This request was at once repudiated (July 30) by the British
Government:&mdash;</p>
<p class="blockquote">'His Majesty's Government cannot for one
moment entertain the Chancellor's proposal that they should bind
themselves to neutrality on such terms.</p>
<p class="blockquote">'What he asks us in effect is to engage to
stand by while French colonies are taken and France is beaten so
long as Germany does not take French territory as distinct from the
colonies.</p>
<p class="blockquote">'From the material point of view the proposal
is unacceptable, for France, without further territory in Europe
being taken from her, could be so crushed as to lose her position
as a Great Power and become subordinate to German policy.</p>
<p class="blockquote">'Altogether apart from that, it would be a
disgrace for us to make this bargain with Germany at the expense of
France, a disgrace from which the good name of this country would
never recover.</p>
<p class="blockquote">'The Chancellor also in effect asks us to
bargain away whatever obligation or interest we have as regards the
neutrality of Belgium. We could not entertain that bargain
either.[<a href="#note-110">110</a>]</p>
<p>He continued by saying that Great Britain must keep her hands
absolutely free and hinted at some scheme for preventing
anti-German aggression by the Powers of the Triple
<i>Entente</i>:&mdash;</p>
<p class="blockquote">'If the peace of Europe can be preserved, and
the present crisis safely passed, my own endeavour will be to
promote some arrangement to which Germany could be a party, by
which she could be assured that no aggressive or hostile policy
would be pursued against her or her allies by France, Russia, and
ourselves, jointly or separately ... The idea has hitherto been too
Utopian to form the subject of definite proposals, but if this
crisis ... be safely passed, I am hopeful that the relief and
reaction which will follow will make possible some more definite
rapprochement between the Powers than has been possible
hitherto.'</p>
<p>Thus two points were made clear: we were seriously concerned
that France should not be crushed, and that the neutrality of
Belgium should not be violated. It is interesting to note how this
extremely serious warning was received by Dr. von
Bethmann-Hollweg:&mdash;'His Excellency was so taken up with the
news of the Russian measures along the frontier ... that he
received your communication without a comment.'[<a href=
"#note-111">111</a>]</p>
<p>But the text of the reply was left with him, so that he could
scarcely complain that no warning had been given to him.</p>
<p>With the data at our disposal, it is not possible to make any
deduction as to the effect which this warning had upon Berlin; but
it may be remarked that at Rome that day, the Marquis di San
Giuliano told Sir Rennell Rodd that he had</p>
<p class="blockquote">'good reason to believe that Germany was now
disposed to give more conciliatory advice to Austria, as she seemed
convinced that we should act with France and Russia, and was most
anxious to avoid issue with us.'[<a href="#note-112">112</a>]</p>
<p>As this telegraphic dispatch was not received till the next day,
it is not impossible that the Italian Minister gave this
information to Sir Rennell Rodd late in the day, after having
received news from Berlin sent under the impression made by Sir
Edward Grey's warning.</p>
<p>Such an impression, if it ever existed, must have been of short
duration, for when the British Government demanded both of France
and Germany whether they were 'prepared to engage to respect
neutrality of Belgium so long as no other Power violates
it',[<a href="#note-113">113</a>] the French gave an unequivocal
promise the same day,[<a href="#note-114">114</a>] while the German
answer is a striking contrast:&mdash;</p>
<p class="blockquote">'I have seen Secretary of State, who informs
me that he must consult the Emperor and the Chancellor before he
can possibly answer. I gathered from what he said that he thought
any reply they might give could not but disclose a certain amount
of their plan of campaign in the event of war ensuing, and he was
therefore very doubtful whether they would return any answer at
all. His Excellency, nevertheless, took note of your request.</p>
<p class="blockquote">'It appears from what he said that German
Government considers that certain hostile acts have already been
committed in Belgium. As an instance of this, he alleged that a
consignment of corn for Germany had been placed under an embargo
already.'[<a href="#note-115">115</a>]</p>
<p>It was now clear that a violation of Belgian neutrality was a
contingency that would have to be faced, and Prince Lichnowsky was
warned the next day that 'the neutrality of Belgium affected
feeling in this country', and he was asked to obtain an assurance
from the German Government similar to that given by
France:&mdash;</p>
<p class="blockquote">'If there were a violation of the neutrality
of Belgium by one combatant, while the other respected it, it would
be extremely difficult to restrain public feeling in this
country.'[<a href="#note-116">116</a>]</p>
<p>The Ambassador then, on his own personal responsibility and
without authority from his Government, tried to exact a promise
that Great Britain would remain neutral 'if Germany gave a promise
not to violate Belgian neutrality', but Sir Edward Grey was bound
to refuse such an offer, seeing that it left out of account all
question of an attack on France and her colonies, about which it
had been stated already that there could be no bargaining. Even the
guarantee of the integrity of France and her colonies was
suggested, but again Sir Edward Grey was bound to refuse, for the
reasons he gave to Sir Edward Goschen in rejecting what is now
known as Dr. von Bethmann-Hollweg's 'infamous proposal', namely,
that France without actually losing territory might be so crushed
as to lose her position as a Great Power, and become subordinate to
German policy. And if there should be still any doubt about Sir
Edward Grey's policy at this moment, we would refer to his
statement in the House of Commons on August 27.[<a href=
"#note-117">117</a>] The important points are that the offers of
August 1 were made on the sole responsibility of Prince Lichnowsky,
and without authority from his Government; that the Cabinet on
August 2 carefully discussed the conditions on which we might
remain neutral, and that, on August 3, so far was the German
Ambassador from guaranteeing the neutrality of Belgium that he
actually had to ask Sir Edward Grey 'not to make the neutrality of
Belgium one of our conditions'. Whatever Prince Lichnowsky may have
said privately on August 1, the one fact certain is that two days
later the German Government were making no concessions on that
point; on the contrary they were asking us to withdraw from a
position we had taken up on July 30, four days before.</p>
<p>One more effort to preserve peace in Western Europe seems to
have been made by Sir Edward Grey. On the telephone he asked Prince
Lichnowsky whether, if France remained neutral, Germany would
promise not to attack her. The impression seems to have prevailed
in Berlin that this was an offer to guarantee French neutrality by
the force of British arms, and the German Emperor in his telegram
to the King gave evidence of the relief His Imperial Majesty felt
at the prospect that the good relations between the two countries
would be maintained. Unfortunately for such hopes, France had never
been consulted in the matter, nor was there ever any idea of
coercing France into neutrality, and even the original proposal had
to be abandoned on consideration as unpractical.[<a href=
"#note-118">118</a>]</p>
<p>Events now marched rapidly. While the Cabinet in London were
still discussing whether a violation of Belgian neutrality would be
an occasion for war, the news came of the violation of that of
Luxemburg. Sir Edward Grey informed M. Cambon[<a href=
"#note-119">119</a>] that Lord Stanley and Lord Clarendon in 1867
had agreed to a 'collective guarantee' by which it was not intended
that every Power was bound single-handed to fight any Government
which violated Luxemburg. Although this gross disregard by the
Germans of their solemn pledge did not entail the same consequences
as the subsequent violation of Belgian neutrality, it is equally
reprehensible from the point of view of international law, and the
more cowardly in proportion as this state is weaker than Belgium.
Against this intrusion Luxemburg protested, but, unlike Belgium,
she did not appeal to the Powers.[<a href="#note-120">120</a>]</p>
<p>Two days later, August 4th, the King of the Belgians appealed to
the King for 'diplomatic intervention to safeguard the integrity of
Belgium'.[<a href="#note-121">121</a>] The German Government had
issued an ultimatum to the Belgian, asking for</p>
<p class="blockquote">'a free passage through Belgian territory,
and promising to maintain the independence and integrity of the
kingdom and its possessions at the conclusion of peace, threatening
in case of refusal to treat Belgium as an enemy. An answer was
requested within twelve hours'.[<a href="#note-122">122</a>]</p>
<p>Sir Edward Grey instructed the British Ambassador to protest
against this violation of a treaty to which Germany in common with
ourselves was a party, and to ask an assurance that the demand made
upon Belgium would not be proceeded with. At the same time the
Belgian Government was told to resist German aggression by all the
means in its power, as Great Britain was prepared to join France
and Russia to maintain the independence and integrity of
Belgium.[<a href="#note-123">123</a>] On receipt of the protest of
Sir Edward Grey, it would seem that Herr von Jagow made one more
desperate effort to bid for British neutrality: 'Germany will,
under no pretence whatever, annex Belgian territory': to pass
through Belgium was necessary because the 'German army could not be
exposed to French attack across Belgium, which was planned
according to absolutely unimpeachable information'. It was for
Germany 'a question of life and death to prevent French
advance'.[<a href="#note-124">124</a>] But matters had gone too
far: that day (August 4) the Germans violated Belgian territory at
Gemmenich, and thereupon the British demand to Germany to respect
Belgian neutrality, issued earlier in the day, was converted into
an ultimatum:&mdash;</p>
<p class="blockquote">'We hear that Germany has addressed note to
Belgian Minister for Foreign Affairs stating that German Government
will be compelled to carry out, if necessary by force of arms, the
measures considered indispensable.</p>
<p class="blockquote">'We are also informed that Belgian territory
has been violated at Gemmenich.</p>
<p class="blockquote">'In these circumstances, and in view of the
fact that Germany declined to give the same assurance respecting
Belgium as France gave last week in reply to our request made
simultaneously at Berlin and Paris, we must repeat that request,
and ask that a satisfactory reply to it and to my telegram of this
morning be received here by 12 o'clock to-night. If not, you are
instructed to ask for your passports, and to say that His Majesty's
Government feel bound to take all steps in their power to uphold
the neutrality of Belgium and the observance of a treaty to which
Germany is as much a party as ourselves.'[<a href=
"#note-125">125</a>]</p>
<p>The effect at Berlin was remarkable. Every sign was given of
disappointment and resentment at such a step being taken, and the
'harangue' of the Chancellor to Sir Edward Goschen, and his
astonishment at the value laid by Great Britain upon the 'scrap of
paper' of 1839 would seem, when coupled with Herr von Jagow's
desperate bid for neutrality at the last moment, to show that the
German Government had counted on the neutrality of this country and
had been deeply disappointed. If these outbursts and attempts at
the eleventh hour to bargain for our neutrality were genuine
efforts to keep the peace between Great Britain and Germany, it is
our belief that their origin must be found in the highest authority
in the German Empire, whom we believe, in spite of petty signs of
spitefulness exhibited since the war broke out, to have been
sincerely and honestly working in favour of European peace, against
obstacles little dreamt of by our countrymen. But certain signs are
not wanting that, in the lower ranks of the German hierarchy, war
with this country had been decided on, and that Sir Edward Grey was
not far wrong when he wrote to Sir Francis Bertie on July 31, 'I
believe it to be quite untrue that our attitude has been a decisive
factor in situation. German Government do not expect our
neutrality.'[<a href="#note-126">126</a>] On what other grounds
than that orders had been sent out from Berlin can the fact be
explained that the German Customs authorities, three days before
the declaration of war, began detaining British ships,[<a href=
"#note-127">127</a>] and compulsorily unloading cargoes of sugar
from British vessels? In the former case, indeed, the ships were
ordered to be released; in the latter case, of which the complaint
was made twenty-four hours later, the reply to inquiries was the
ominous statement that 'no information was to be had'.[<a href=
"#note-128">128</a>]</p>
<p>This, however, is a digression from the main question. History
will doubtless attribute the outbreak of war between ourselves and
Germany to the development of the Belgian question, and, we are
confident, will judge that had it not been for the gratuitous
attack made on a neutral country by Germany, war with Great Britain
would not have ensued on August 4, 1914. The excuses put forward by
the German Government for this wanton outrage on international
agreements are instructive. In conversation with Sir Edward
Goschen, neither Herr von Jagow nor the Chancellor urged that the
French had violated the neutrality; the argument is purely and
simply that the route by way of the Vosges is difficult, time is
everything, and it is a matter of life and death to Germany to
crush France as quickly as possible, in order that she may be able
to meet the Russians before they reach the German frontier. This
excuse does not seem to have been very satisfactory even to those
who put it forward, though it was indubitably the real reason; so
vice paid homage to virtue, and Herr von Jagow urged to Prince
Lichnowsky that he had 'absolutely unimpeachable information' that
the German army was exposed to French attack across Belgium. On the
other hand, the Chancellor, as late as August 4th, seems to have
known nothing of any such action by France; at any rate he made no
mention of it in his speech to the Reichstag:&mdash;</p>
<p class="blockquote">'We are now in a state of necessity, and
necessity knows no law. Our troops have occupied Luxemburg and
perhaps are already on Belgian soil. Gentlemen, that is contrary to
the dictates of international law. It is true that the French
Government has declared at Brussels that France is willing to
respect the neutrality of Belgium, as long as her opponent respects
it. We knew, however, that France stood ready for invasion. France
could wait but we could not wait. A French movement upon our flank
upon the Lower Rhine might have been disastrous. So we were
compelled to override the just protest of the Luxemburg and Belgian
Governments. The wrong&mdash;I speak openly&mdash;that we are
committing we will endeavour to make good as soon as our military
goal has been reached. Anybody who is threatened as we are
threatened, and is fighting for his highest possessions, can only
have one thought&mdash;how he is to hack his way through.'[<a href=
"#note-129">129</a>]</p>
<p>In this double-faced position of the German Government, we have
an example either of unsurpassed wickedness or of insurpassable
folly. The violation of Belgium must have been designed either in
order to bring us into the quarrel, or on the supposition that, in
spite of treaties and warnings, we should yet remain neutral. Yet
the foolishness of such a calculation is as nothing to that which
prompted the excuse that Germany had to violate Belgian neutrality
because the French were going to do so, or had done so. In such a
case undoubtedly the wisest course for Germany would have been to
allow the French to earn the reward of their own folly and be
attacked not only by Belgium but also by Great Britain, to whom not
five days before they had solemnly promised to observe the
neutrality, and whom such a gross violation of the French word must
indubitably have kept neutral, if it did not throw her on to the
side of Germany. In regard to Belgium the Germans have indeed put
forward the plea that the French had already violated its
neutrality before war was declared. This plea has been like a
snowball. It began with the ineffective accusation that the French
were at Givet, a town in French territory, and that this
constituted an attack on Germany, though how the presence of the
French in a town of their own could be called a violation of their
neighbour's neutrality it is difficult to see. From that it has
gradually grown into a more formidable story of the French
supplying a garrison to Li&egrave;ge. There can be little doubt
that all these attempts by Herr von Jagow to claim that the French
violated Belgian neutrality are another illustration of Swift's
dictum to the effect that 'as universal a practice as lying is, and
as easy a one as it seems', it is astonishing that it has been
brought to so little perfection, 'even by those who are most
celebrated in that faculty'.[<a href="#note-130">130</a>]</p>
<h3>IV</h3>
<center><i>England and Servia</i>.</center>
<p>We have seen what attitude was taken by Germany in the crisis
which followed upon the Serajevo murders and more definitely upon
the presentation of the Austrian note. It is equally important, and
to English readers at least more interesting, to realize what
attitude was taken by England. Sir Edward Grey throughout
maintained the position, which he was so justly praised for
adopting in 1912, that England had no direct interest in Balkan
disputes, but that it was her bounden duty to prevent a European
conflagration. He quickly saw, what Germany would not see, that
Russia was so much interested in Servia, for both political and
religious reasons, that any attempt by the Austro-Hungarian
Government to coerce Servia, to interfere with her territorial
integrity or independence as a sovereign state, would inevitably
rouse Russia to military action. For Russia had greater interests
in the security of Servia than Great Britain had in the security of
Belgium. In each case the Great Power was bound by honour and
self-interest alike to interfere to protect the smaller Power, but
Russia was also bound to Servia by racial and religious bonds. This
being so, Sir Edward Grey set himself, not as the German White Book
says[<a href="#note-131">131</a>] to localize the conflict, but to
prevent if possible a conflict between Austria-Hungary and Servia
which would inevitably involve Russia and probably other European
powers. He stated his policy with the greatest clearness in the
House of Commons on July 27th, but he had already acted on the
lines of the policy which he then explained. On July 24th he told
Count Mensdorff that he would concern himself</p>
<p class="blockquote">'with the matter simply and solely from the
point of view of the peace of Europe. The merits of the dispute
between Austria and Servia were not the concern of His Majesty's
Government[<a href="#note-132">132</a>].'</p>
<p>In similar language, but more fully, on the same day he told the
German Ambassador:&mdash;</p>
<p class="blockquote">'If the presentation of this ultimatum to
Servia did not lead to trouble between Austria and Russia, we need
not concern ourselves about it; but if Russia took the view of the
Austrian ultimatum which it seemed to me that any Power interested
in Servia would take, I should be quite powerless, in face of the
terms of the ultimatum, to exercise any moderating
influence[<a href="#note-133">133</a>].'</p>
<p>Sir Edward Grey at once urged that the four Powers, Germany,
Italy, France, and Great Britain, should act together in the
interests of peace at the courts of St. Petersburg and Vienna. And
he went further and tried to induce Servia to 'express concern and
regret' and to 'give Austria the fullest satisfaction', 'if it is
proved that Servian officials, however subordinate, were
accomplices in the murders at Serajevo[<a href=
"#note-134">134</a>].' Further than that no British Foreign
Minister could go; Sir George Buchanan correctly explained the
situation to M. Sazonof when he laid stress on the need of the
sanction of British public opinion[<a href="#note-135">135</a>].
Sir Edward Grey re-echoed this when he wrote:&mdash;</p>
<p class="blockquote">'I do not consider that public opinion here
would or ought to sanction our going to war over a Servian quarrel.
If, however, war does take place, the development of other issues
may draw us into it, and I am therefore anxious to prevent
it.'[<a href="#note-136">136</a>]</p>
<p>However, matters were moving rapidly: the Servian reply[<a href=
"#note-137">137</a>] was presented on July 25; it was considered
unsatisfactory by the Austro-Hungarian Government, and the
Minister, with the Legation-staff, withdrew from Belgrade. Next day
Sir Edward Grey proposed that a conference of Germany, Italy,
France, and Great Britain should meet in London immediately 'for
the purpose of discovering an issue which would prevent
complications', and 'that all active military operations should be
suspended pending results of conference'.[<a href=
"#note-138">138</a>] This proposal failed, as has been explained in
earlier pages (<a href="#failedproposal">pp. 71-3</a>), and on July
28th Austria-Hungary declared war on Servia. Sir Edward Grey
remained firm to his original attitude of non-intervention, and
told M. Cambon that 'the dispute between Austria and Servia was not
one in which we felt called to take a hand'.[<a href=
"#note-139">139</a>] And on the same day he declined to discuss
with Count Mensdorff 'the merits of the question between Austria
and Servia'.[<a href="#note-140">140</a>]</p>
<p>No one can doubt that Sir Edward Grey's attitude was
diplomatically correct and consistent. It was also inspired by a
genuine desire for peace, and stands out in sharp contrast with the
'equivocal and double-faced' policy of Germany, and with the
obstinacy of Austria in refusing to permit the Powers to mediate;
for it was with truth that M. Sazonof remarked that</p>
<p class="blockquote">'a refusal to prolong the term of the
ultimatum would render nugatory the proposals made by the
Austro-Hungarian Government to the Powers, and would be in
contradiction to the very basis of international
relations.'[<a href="#note-141">141</a>]</p>
<h3>V</h3>
<center><i>Great Britain declines 'Solidarity' with Russia and
France</i>.</center>
<p>There is however another question which involves the whole
foreign policy of Great Britain. Could Sir Edward Grey have
prevented the war by boldly declaring at once that England would
support Russia and France, if necessary by armed force? It was a
policy urged on him from several quarters, and it is possible that
such action might have been successful. It is to Sir Edward Grey's
credit that he quietly but firmly refused to take so hazardous and
unprecedented a step. Let us examine these proposals briefly. As
early as July 24th M. Sazonof 'hoped that His Majesty's Government
would not fail to proclaim their solidarity with Russia and
France.[<a href="#note-142">142</a>]' The French Ambassador at St.
Petersburg joined in the request, and M. Sazonof pointed out
that</p>
<p class="blockquote">'we would sooner or later be dragged into war
if it did break out; we should have rendered war more likely if we
did not from the outset make common cause with his country and with
France[<a href="#note-143">143</a>].'</p>
<p>On July 30th the President of the French Republic expressed his
conviction that</p>
<p class="blockquote">'peace between the Powers is in the hands of
Great Britain. If His Majesty's Government announced that England
would come to the aid of France in the event of a conflict between
France and Germany, as a result of the present differences between
Austria and Servia, there would be no war, for Germany would at
once modify her attitude[<a href="#note-144">144</a>].'</p>
<p>Even more important was the opinion of the Italian Minister for
Foreign Affairs, whose country was a member of the Triple
Alliance:&mdash;</p>
<p class="blockquote">'As Germany was really anxious for good
relations with ourselves, if she believed that Great Britain would
act with Russia and France, he thought it would have a great
effect.'[<a href="#note-145">145</a>]</p>
<p>Such opinions must, and do, carry great weight, but Sir Edward
Grey and the British Ambassadors were equally firm in withstanding
them. Sir George Buchanan at once told M. Sazonof that he</p>
<p class="blockquote">'saw no reason to expect any declaration of
solidarity from His Majesty's Government that would entail an
unconditional engagement on their part to support Russia and France
by force of arms'.[<a href="#note-146">146</a>]</p>
<p>On July 27th he met the proposal more directly by pointing out
that, so far from such a policy conducing to the maintenance of
peace, it would merely offend the pride of the Germans and stiffen
them in their present attitude.[<a href="#note-147">147</a>] Two
days later Sir Edward Grey pointed out to M. Cambon that</p>
<p class="blockquote">'even if the question became one between
Austria and Russia, we should not feel called upon to take a hand
in it. It would then be a question of the supremacy of Teuton or
Slav&mdash;a struggle for supremacy in the Balkans; and our idea
had always been to avoid being drawn into a war over a Balkan
question'.[<a href="#note-148">148</a>]</p>
<p>That is one answer to the proposal, an answer based on history
and on Britain's foreign policy in past years. Sir Edward Grey had
another answer. It was to the effect that Germany could not, and
ought to have known she could not, rely on our neutrality. For when
the Russian Ambassador told him that an impression prevailed in
German and Austrian circles that in any event England would stand
aside, he pointed out that</p>
<p class="blockquote">'this impression ought to be dispelled by the
orders we have given to the First Fleet, which is concentrated, as
it happens, at Portland, not to disperse for manoeuvre
leave'.[<a href="#note-149">149</a>]</p>
<p>The situation continued to develop unfavourably for the cause of
peace owing to the Austrian declaration of war on Servia, and the
consequent mobilizations in Russia, Germany, and France. On July
31st Sir Edward Grey said:&mdash;</p>
<p class="blockquote">'I believe it to be quite untrue that our
attitude has been a decisive factor in situation. German Government
do not expect our neutrality.'[<a href="#note-150">150</a>]</p>
<p>It is not quite clear that Sir Edward Grey's belief was
justified. England's attitude may have been an important factor in
the situation, but still in our opinion Sir Edward Grey was not
only right in refusing to commit England to a new Continental
policy, but could not, with due observance of constitutional
usages, have taken any other course. Again, it is doubtful whether
the German Government did or did not rely on our neutrality. The
German Chancellor and the German Secretary for Foreign Affairs
later affected great surprise at our action. Germany, however, as
we have shown above (<a href="#ch5sec3">p. 82</a>), had been
plainly warned by Sir Edward Grey on July 29th[<a href=
"#note-151">151</a>] that she could not rely on our remaining
neutral under all circumstances.</p>
<p>Whether Sir Edward Grey was right or wrong in his estimate of
Germany's prudence is a small matter; what is important is that his
action was throughout perfectly straightforward and consistent. And
unquestionably he had a very difficult part to play. The near East
was like a blazing rick surrounded by farm buildings; Germany was,
if not stirring up the conflagration, certainly not attempting to
pour water on the flames, while Austria, possibly&mdash;and even
probably[<a href="#note-152">152</a>] with Germany's knowledge,
would allow no one to make the attempt.</p>
<p>It would have aided the Austrian cause more effectively in
Europe and elsewhere, if the Government had communicated[<a href=
"#note-153">153</a>] 'the <i>dossier</i> elucidating the Servian
intrigues and the connexion between these intrigues and the murder
of 28th June', which it said it held at the disposal of the British
Government.[<a href="#note-154">154</a>] For even Count Mensdorff
'admitted that, on paper, the Servian reply might seem to be
satisfactory'.[<a href="#note-155">155</a>]</p>
<p>To judge whether the Servian reply was satisfactory, it was, and
is, necessary to examine the evidence on which the Austro-Hungarian
Government based the accusations formulated in its note of July
23rd. But even assuming that the Austrian charges were true, as the
German White Book says they are,[<a href="#note-156">156</a>] it is
only a stronger reason for allowing the Powers to examine this
evidence; and it does not explain the persistent refusal,[<a href=
"#note-157">157</a>] until July 31st,[<a href="#note-158">158</a>]
to permit any negotiations on the basis of the Servian reply.</p>
<p>Such being the situation, it is very difficult to see what more
Sir Edward Grey could have done to prevent the outbreak of war
between Austria-Hungary and Servia, which did inevitably, as he
foresaw from the first, drag in other nations. He urged Servia to
moderation and even to submission; he tried to induce the four
Powers to mediate jointly at St. Petersburg and Vienna; he proposed
a conference of the four Powers to prevent further complications;
he did everything in his power to restrain Russia from immediate
armed support of Servia; he declined to join Russia and France in
eventual military action; and even up to the violation of the
neutrality of Belgium he still strove to avert the horrors of war
from Europe.</p>
<h3>VI</h3>
<center><i>Italy's comments on the situation</i>.</center>
<p>We have already shown (<a href="#CH2">Chap. II</a>) how Italy
became a member of the Triple Alliance, and how, in spite of its
apparent frailty and of the somewhat divergent aims of its members,
that alliance has endured for thirty-two years. It remains to
consider what policy Italy adopted in the critical situation
created by the presentation of the Austro-Hungarian note to Servia,
and to appreciate the significance of that policy. It is supremely
significant that Italy, though a member of the Triple Alliance, was
not consulted about the terms of the Austrian note to Servia; that
she worked persistently side by side with England in endeavouring
to prevent an outbreak of war, and, when that failed, to induce the
states actually at war, or on the brink of war, to suspend all
military operations in order to give diplomatic intervention an
opportunity; and it is equally significant that, when the great war
broke out, Italy remained neutral, in spite of the pressure from
her allies and the tempting bait of a share of the spoil, which, it
is said, is even now being offered to her.[<a href=
"#note-159">159</a>] This is but a bald description of Italy's
policy, but it can be substantiated in detail from official
documents. As early as July 25th the Italian Ambassador in a
conversation with Sir Edward Grey 'made no secret of the fact that
Italy was desirous to see war avoided',[<a href=
"#note-160">160</a>] and he cordially approved the idea of
mediation by the four Powers. Two days later Italy again approved
the proposed conference of four to be held immediately in London.
The Italian Foreign Minister promised to recommend most strongly to
the German Government the idea of asking Russia, Austria, and
Servia to suspend military operations pending the result of the
conference, and went even further in undertaking to ask what
procedure Germany thought most likely to be successful at
Vienna.[<a href="#note-161">161</a>] He thought it very doubtful
whether Germany would consent to ask Austria to suspend military
operations, but made a further suggestion that</p>
<p class="blockquote">'Servia may be induced to accept note in its
entirety on the advice of the four Powers invited to the
conference, and this would enable her to say that she had yielded
to Europe and not to Austria-Hungary alone'.[<a href=
"#note-162">162</a>]</p>
<p>Next day the Marquis di San Giuliano called attention to a point
in Servia's reply to Austria which might form a starting-point for
mediation.[<a href="#note-163">163</a>] On July 29th he tried to
get over Germany's objection to the idea of a 'Conference' by
suggesting adherence to the idea of an exchange of views in
London.[<a href="#note-164">164</a>] Next day he added to this the
practical suggestion that</p>
<p class="blockquote">'Germany might invite Austria to state
exactly the terms which she would demand from Servia, and give a
guarantee that she would neither deprive her of independence, nor
annex territory.... We might, on the other hand, ascertain from
Russia what she would accept, and, once we knew the standpoints of
these two countries, discussions could be commenced at
once.'[<a href="#note-165">165</a>]</p>
<p>Moreover the Italian Ambassador at Vienna, in the hope of
pacifying Russia, made the useful suggestion that Austria
should</p>
<p class="blockquote">'convert into a binding engagement to Europe
the declaration which has been made at St. Petersburg to the effect
that she desires neither to destroy the independence of Servia, nor
to acquire Servian territory'.[<a href="#note-166">166</a>]</p>
<p>All efforts to preserve peace proved futile; Germany delivered
her ultimatum to France and to Russia. Then arose the question,
what was Italy to do? The answer to this was given by the Italian
Foreign Minister:&mdash;</p>
<p class="blockquote">'The war undertaken by Austria, and the
consequences which might result, had, in the words of the German
Ambassador himself, an aggressive object. Both were therefore in
conflict with the purely defensive character of the Triple
Alliance; in such circumstances Italy would remain
neutral.'[<a href="#note-167">167</a>]</p>
<p>The German White Book says 'Russia began the war on us'[<a href=
"#note-168">168</a>] and 'France opened hostilities'[<a href=
"#note-169">169</a>]; if these statements were true, Italy would
have been obliged, if she were to remain faithful to her
engagements, to take part in the war side by side with her
colleagues of the Triple Alliance. Impartial readers can draw their
own conclusions.</p>

<h3>NOTE</h3>
<center><i>Austro-Hungarian note to Servia, and Servia's
reply</i>.</center>
<p>On July 23rd the Austro-Hungarian Government presented an
ultimatum to Servia, demanding unconditional acceptance within 48
hours, an ultimatum which the <i>Temps</i> next day described as
'unprecedented in its arrogance and in the extravagance of its
demands'. Of it Sir Edward Grey said:&mdash;</p>
<p class="blockquote">'I had never before seen one State address to
another independent State a document of so formidable a character.
Demand No. 5 would be hardly consistent with the maintenance of
Servia's independent sovereignty, if it were to mean, as it seemed
that it might, that Austria-Hungary was to be invested with a right
to appoint officials who would have authority within the frontiers
of Servia.'[<a href="#note-170">170</a>]</p>
<p>It may be true, as the Austrian Ambassador explained,[<a href=
"#note-171">171</a>] that the Austro-Hungarian Government did not
intend this step to be regarded as an ultimatum, but as a
<i>d&eacute;marche</i> with a time-limit.</p>
<p>In this extraordinary document[<a href="#note-172">172</a>] the
Austro-Hungarian Government demanded:&mdash;</p>
<p>A. That Servia should publish on the front page of its 'Official
Gazette', and in the 'Official Bulletin' of the Army, and should
communicate to the Army as the order of the day a declaration</p>
<p>(1) condemning Serb propaganda against Austria-Hungary;</p>
<p>(2) regretting that Servian officers and functionaries
participated in the propaganda;</p>
<p>(3) promising to proceed with the utmost rigour against persons
who may be guilty of such machinations.</p>
<p>B. That Servia should undertake</p>
<p>(1) to suppress any publication inciting to hatred and contempt
of Austria-Hungary;</p>
<p>(2) to dissolve the society styled Narodna Odbrana and similar
societies and to confiscate their means of propaganda;</p>
<p>(3) to eliminate from public instruction in Servia all teachers
and all methods of instruction responsible for fomenting opinion
against Austria-Hungary;</p>
<p>(4) to remove from the military service and from the
administration all officers and functionaries guilty of such
propaganda, whose names and deeds the Austro-Hungarian Government
reserved to itself the right of communicating;</p>
<p>(5) to accept the collaboration in Servia of representatives of
Austria-Hungary in the suppression of the subversive anti-Austrian
movement;</p>
<p>(6) to take judicial proceedings against accessories to the
Serajevo plot, with the co-operation of Austro-Hungarian
delegates;</p>
<p>(7) to proceed immediately to the arrest of Major Voija
Tankositch and of Milan Ciganovitch, a Servian State
employ&eacute;, who have been compromised by the results of the
inquiry at Serajevo;</p>
<p>(8) to stop co-operation of Servian authorities in illicit
traffic in arms and explosives, and to dismiss and punish those
officials who helped the perpetrators of the Serajevo crime;</p>
<p>(9) to explain the unjustifiable utterances of high Servian
officials, at home and abroad, after the Serajevo crime.</p>
<p>On July 25th the Servian reply[<a href="#note-173">173</a>] was
presented to the Austro-Hungarian Government. Even to a reader with
Austrian sympathies this reply seems to go a long way towards
meeting the demands. The Servian Government agreed</p>
<p>A. that Servia should, as demanded, publish a declaration</p>
<p>(1) condemning all propaganda which may be directed against
Austria-Hungary;</p>
<p>(2) regretting that, according to the communication from the
Imperial and Royal Government, Servian officers and officials
participated in the propaganda;</p>
<p>(3) promising to proceed with the utmost rigour against all
persons who are guilty of such acts.</p>
<p>B. That Servia would undertake</p>
<p>(1) to introduce a provision into the press law providing for
the most severe punishment of incitement to hatred and contempt of
Austria-Hungary and to introduce an amendment to the Constitution
providing for the confiscation of such publications;</p>
<p>(2) to dissolve the Narodna Odbrana and similar societies;</p>
<p>(3) to remove at once from their public educational
establishments all that serves or could serve to foment propaganda,
whenever the Austro-Hungarian Government furnish them with facts
and proofs of this propaganda;</p>
<p>(4) to remove from military service all such persons as the
judicial inquiry may have proved to be guilty of acts directed
against the territorial integrity of Austria-Hungary;</p>
<p>(5) though they do not clearly grasp the meaning or the scope of
the demand, to accept the collaboration of Austro-Hungarian
officials so far as is consistent with the principle of
international law, with criminal procedure and with good
neighbourly relations;</p>
<p>(6) to take judicial proceedings against accessories to the
Serajevo plot; but they cannot admit the co-operation of
Austro-Hungarian officials, as it would be a violation of the
Constitution and of the law of criminal procedure;</p>
<p>(7) On this they remark that Major Tankositch was arrested as
soon as the note was presented, and that it has not been possible
to arrest Ciganovitch, who is an Austro-Hungarian subject, but had
been employed (on probation) by the directorate of railways;</p>
<p>(8) to reinforce and extend the measures for preventing illicit
traffic of arms and explosives across the frontier;</p>
<p>(9) to give explanations of the remarks made by Servian
officials, as soon as the Austro-Hungarian Government have
communicated the passages and as soon as they have shown that the
remarks were actually made by the said officials.</p>
<p>The Austro-Hungarian Government regarded this reply as
unsatisfactory and inadequate; they withdrew their Minister from
Belgrade the same evening, and on July 28th declared war on Servia.
Meanwhile they published a long official explanation[<a href=
"#note-174">174</a>] of the grounds on which the Servian reply was
considered inadequate; in it they criticized and found
unsatisfactory every single article of the reply, except that to
demand No. 8. It is not worth while to analyze the whole of this;
one sample may be sufficient. Sir Edward Grey commented on demand
No. 5 and pointed out[<a href="#note-175">175</a>] that it</p>
<p class="blockquote">'would be hardly consistent with the
maintenance of Servia's independent sovereignty, if it were to
mean, as it seemed that it might, that Austria-Hungary was to be
invested with a right to appoint officials who would have authority
within the frontiers of Servia.'</p>
<p>Obviously he was in doubt about the meaning and scope of this
demand, and the next was equally vague. The Servian reply to these
two demands was necessarily guarded: yet the Austro-Hungarian
Government treated this as deliberate misrepresentation:&mdash;</p>
<p class="blockquote">'The international law, as well as the
criminal law, has nothing to do with this question; it is purely a
matter of the nature of state police which is to be solved by way
of a special agreement. The reserved attitude of Servia is
therefore incomprehensible, and on account of its vague general
form it would lead to unbridgeable difficulties.</p>
<p class="blockquote">...</p>
<p class="blockquote">'If the Servian Government misunderstands us
here, this is done deliberately, for it must be familiar with the
difference between "enqu&ecirc;te judiciaire" and simple police
researches. As it desired to escape from every control of the
investigation which would yield, if correctly carried out, highly
undesirable results for it, and as it possesses no means to refuse
in a plausible manner the co-operation of our officials (precedents
for such police intervention exist in great number), it tries to
justify its refusal by showing up our demands as
impossible.'[<a href="#note-176">176</a>]</p>
<p>It would have been fairer to Servia to assume that there had
been a genuine misunderstanding, and that the explanation here
given by Austria might prove satisfactory to Servia, as the Italian
Minister for Foreign Affairs suggested.[<a href=
"#note-177">177</a>] The persistent refusal of Austria-Hungary to
permit any discussion on the basis of the Servian reply goes far to
justify Sir Maurice de Bunsen's impression</p>
<p class="blockquote">'that the Austro-Hungarian note was so drawn
up as to make war inevitable, that their Government are fully
resolved to have war with Servia, that they consider their position
as a Great Power to be at stake, and that until punishment has been
administered to Servia it is unlikely that they will listen to
proposals of mediation'.[<a href="#note-178">178</a>]</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI</h2>
<center>THE NEW GERMAN THEORY OF THE STATE</center>
<p>The war in which England is now engaged with Germany is
fundamentally a war between two different principles&mdash;that of
<i>raison d'&eacute;tat</i>, and that of the rule of law. The
antagonism between these two principles appeared in our own
internal history as far back as the seventeenth century, when the
Stuarts championed the theory of state-necessity and the practice
of a prerogative free to act outside and above the law in order to
meet the demands of state-necessity, and when Parliament defended
the rule of law and sought to include the Crown under that law. The
same antagonism now appears externally in a struggle between two
nations, one of which claims a prerogative to act outside and above
the public law of Europe in order to secure the 'safety' of its own
state, while the other stands for the rule of public law. The one
regards international covenants to which it has pledged its own
word as 'scraps of paper' when they stand in the way of <i>salus
populi</i>; the other regards the maintenance of such covenants as
a grave and inevitable obligation.</p>
<p>Taught by Treitschke, whom they regard as their great national
historian, and whose lectures on <i>Politik</i> have become a
gospel, the Germans of to-day assume as an ultimate end and a final
standard what they regard as the national German state.[<a href=
"#note-179">179</a>] 'The state', says Treitschke, 'is the highest
thing in the external society of man: above it there is nothing at
all in the history of the world.' There is here no room for comity
of nations; for a <i>societas totius humani generis</i>; for
international law in any true sense. What really exists is the
exclusive state&mdash;<i>der geschlossene Staat</i>&mdash;and in
another sense than that of Fichte. This state is rigorously
national: it excludes all foreign words from its vocabulary, and it
would fain exclude all foreign articles from its shores in order to
found a real 'national' economy such as List preached. Further, in
the teaching of Treitschke this exclusive state is, 'as Machiavelli
first clearly saw', essentially power: <i>der Staat ist Macht</i>.
It may be defined as 'the public might for defence and offence'. As
the highest duty of the individual is self-perfection, the highest
duty of the state is self-preservation; and self-preservation means
power. 'To care for its power is the highest moral duty of the
state.' 'Of all political weaknesses that of feebleness is the most
abominable and despicable: it is the sin against the Holy Spirit of
Politics.' This may seem the mere worship of might, and it is in
effect nothing else than the mere worship of might; but we should
misrepresent Treitschke if we did not add that power is not
conceived by him as mere or bare power. The power of the state is
precious and ultimate because the state is a vehicle of culture:
the armed sword of the German state is precious because that state
is the <i>colporteur</i> of German culture. And thus Treitschke
holds that Machiavelli, the great apostle of might, is only wrong
in so far as he failed to see that might must justify itself by
having a content, that is to say, by being used to spread the
highest moral culture. It is naturally assumed by German
nationalists that this is German culture.</p>
<p>Two results flow from this philosophy, one negative, the other
positive. The negative result is the repudiation of any idea of the
final character of international obligation; the other is the
praise of the glory of war.</p>
<p><i>Salus populi suprema lex</i>; and to it all international
'law' so called must bend. The absolute sovereignty of the state is
necessary for its absolute power; and that absolute sovereignty
cannot be bound by <i>any</i> obligation, even of its own making.
Every treaty or promise made by a state, Treitschke holds, is to be
understood as limited by the proviso <i>rebus sic stantibus</i>. 'A
state cannot bind its will for the future over against other
states.' International treaties are no absolute limitation, but a
voluntary self-limitation of the state, and only for such time as
the state may find to be convenient. The state has no judge set
over it, and any 'legal' obligation it may incur is in the last
resort subject to its own decision&mdash;in other words, to its own
repudiation.[<a href="#note-180">180</a>] That the end justifies
the means (in other words, that the maintenance of the German
Empire as it stands justifies the violation of an international
obligation) 'has a certain truth'. 'It is ridiculous to advise a
state which is in competition with other states to start by taking
the catechism into its hands.' All these hints of his master were
adopted and expanded by Bernhardi, the faithful disciple of
Treitschke, whose Berlin lectures were attended in the last quarter
of the nineteenth century by soldiers and officials as well as by
students. There is no such thing, Bernhardi feels, as universal
international law. 'Each nation evolves its own conception of Right
(<i>Recht</i>): none can say that one nation has a better
conception than another.' 'No self-respecting nation would
sacrifice its own conception of Right' to any international rule:
'by so doing it would renounce its own highest ideals.' The ardent
nationalism which will reject foreign words and foreign wares will
reject international law as something 'foreign'. Again, Bernhardi
makes play with the proviso <i>rebus sic stantibus</i>; and this,
curiously enough, he does in reference to Belgium. Things are
altered in Belgium, and therefore the plighted word of Germany may
no longer be binding. 'When Belgium was proclaimed neutral, no one
contemplated that she would lay claim to a large and valuable
region of Africa. It may well be asked whether the acquisition of
such territory is not <i>ipso facto</i> a breach of
neutrality.'[<a href="#note-181">181</a>]</p>
<p>But it is the glorification of war&mdash;war aggressive as well
as war defensive&mdash;which is the most striking result of the
doctrine of the all-sufficing, all-embracing national state. In the
index to Treitschke's <i>Politik</i>, under the word War, one reads
the following headings&mdash;'its sanctity'; 'to be conceived as an
ordinance set by God'; 'is the most powerful maker of nations'; 'is
politics <i>par excellence</i>'. Two functions, says Treitschke,
the state exists to discharge; and these are to administer law, and
to make war. Of the two war, since it is politics <i>par
excellence</i>, would appear to be the greater. War cannot be
thought or wished out of the world: it is the only medicine for a
sick nation. When we are sunk in the selfish individualism of
peace, war comes to make us realize that we are members one of
another. 'Therein lies the majesty of war, that the petty
individual altogether vanishes before the great thought of the
state.' War alone makes us realize the social organism to which we
belong: 'it is political idealism which demands war.' And again,
'what a perversion of morality it were, if one struck out of
humanity heroism'(<i>Heldentum</i>)&mdash;as if <i>Heldentum</i>
could not exist in peace! 'But the living God will see to it that
war shall always recur as a terrible medicine for humanity.'</p>
<p>Thus the idealization of the state as power results in the
idealization of war. As we have seen that the state must be 'power'
in order to preserve itself at all, we now find that it must be a
war-state to preserve itself from 'sickness'. If it does not fight,
individualism will triumph over the social organism; heroism will
perish out of the world. Hence Bernhardi writes: 'the maintenance
of peace never can or may be the goal of a policy'. War,
war&mdash;the 'strong medicine', the teacher of heroism, and, as
Bernhardi adds to Treitschke, the inevitable biological law, the
force that spreads the finest culture&mdash;war is the law of
humanity. And this war is offensive as well as
defensive&mdash;primarily, indeed, offensive. For the growing
nation must preserve all its new members in its bosom: it must not
let them slip away by emigration to foreign soils. It must
therefore find for itself colonies; and since the world is already
largely occupied, it must find them by conquest from other
powers.[<a href="#note-182">182</a>] Treitschke already cried the
watchwords&mdash;'Colonies!' 'Sea-power to gain colonies!'
Treitschke already designated England as the object of German
attack, and began to instil in Germany a hatred of England. England
blocked the way to the growth of Germany from a European into a
World-power; Germany, to preserve intact for German culture the
surplus of the growing population, must be a World-power or perish.
And besides, England was a 'sick' state&mdash;a sham, an
hypocrisy.[<a href="#note-183">183</a>]</p>
<p>The whole philosophy seems paganism, or rather barbarism, with a
moral veneer. It seems barbarism, because it brings us back to the
good old days when mere might was right. Bernhardi, speaking of the
right of conquest of new territory inherent in a growing people,
tells us that in such cases 'might is at once the supreme right,
and the dispute as to what is right is decided by the arbitrament
of war', which gives a 'biologically just decision'! And he
expresses wonder and surprise at those who think that 'the weak
nation is to have the same right to live as the powerful and
vigorous nation'. In a word, then, might is right. The doctrine has
in itself a rude barbaric simplicity: what is utterly revolting in
the neo-Germanic presentment is its moral veneer&mdash;the talk of
war as the fruit of 'political idealism' and the expression of the
'social organism': the talk of 'historical development' as
invalidating supposed 'rights' like the neutrality of Belgium;
above all, the talk of power as 'the vehicle of the highest
culture'. Treitschke, a stern Protestant, seeks to reconcile the
doctrine with Christianity; but the doctrine is all the same pagan.
It is the worship of brute force disguised as <i>Heldentum</i>, and
of vicious cunning disguised as political morality: it is a mixture
of Nietzsche[<a href="#note-184">184</a>] and of Machiavelli. It is
a doctrine of the omnipotence of the super-nation, which 'to
maintain its state', as Machiavelli said, 'will go to work against
faith and charity and humanity and religion', and which will stride
ruthlessly to war when 'the day' comes. And when it goes to war,
all the veneer of culture goes. 'Have a care', Mommsen once said,
'lest in this state, which has been at once a power in arms and a
power in intelligence, the intelligence should vanish, and nothing
but the pure military state should remain.' Mommsen's warning has
come true in August, 1914. By their fruits ye shall know them. The
fruits of <i>Heldentum</i> are Louvain smoking in ashes to the
sky.</p>
<p>It has seemed worth while to describe this philosophy of life,
because it is not only the philosophy of a professor like
Treitschke, but also that of a soldier like Bernhardi; and not only
so, but it is the philosophy of the Prussian Government. Even the
Imperial Chancellor himself used this doctrine (with some qualms,
it is true) to justify Germany in 'hewing its way' through Belgium.
Let us only remember, in justice to a great people, that it is not
really the doctrine of Germany, but rather the doctrine of Prussia
(though Treitschke will tell us that Germany is 'just merely an
extended Prussia'). And let us remember, in extenuation of Prussia,
that she has suffered from two things&mdash;geographical pressure
springing from her mid-European situation, and an evil tradition of
ruthless conquest perpetuated by her Hohenzollern rulers since the
days of the Great Elector, and especially since Frederic the Great.
Geographical pressure on all sides has made Prussia feel herself in
a state of chronic strangulation; and a man who feels strangled
will struggle ruthlessly for breath. To get breathing space, to
secure frontiers which would ease an intolerable pressure, Frederic
the Great could seize Silesia in time of peace in spite of his
father's guarantee of the Pragmatic Sanction, and could suggest the
partition of Poland. Frontier pressure thus led to ruthless
conquest irrespective of rights; and that tradition has sunk deep.
It has been easier for England, an island state in the West exempt
from pressure, to think in other terms: it has been possible for
Russia, secure in the East, to think, and to think nobly (as the
present Tsar has done), of international obligation. Nor is it an
accident that sees England and Russia united in the common cause of
Europe to-day&mdash;that sees both championing the cause of small
nations, one in the East, the other in the West.[<a href=
"#note-185">185</a>]</p>
<p>But in whatever way we may excuse Prussia we must fight Prussia;
and we fight it in the noblest cause for which men can fight. That
cause is the public law of Europe, as a sure shield and buckler of
all nations, great and small, and especially the small. To the
doctrine of the almightiness of the state&mdash;to the doctrine
that all means are justified which are, or seem, necessary to its
self-preservation, we oppose the doctrine of a European society, or
at least a European comity of nations, within which all states
stand; we oppose the doctrine of a public law of Europe, by which
all states are bound to respect the covenants they have made. We
will not and cannot tolerate the view that nations are 'in the
state and posture of gladiators' in their relations one with
another; we stand for the reign of law.</p>
<p>Our cause, as one would expect from a people that has fought out
its own internal struggles under the forms of law, is a legal
cause. We are a people in whose blood the cause of law is the vital
element. It is no new thing in our history that we should fight for
that cause. When England and Revolutionary France went to war in
1793, the cause, on the side of England, was a legal cause. We
fought for the public law of Europe, as it had stood since the
Peace of Westphalia in 1648. We did not fight in 1870, because
neither France nor Germany had infringed the public law of Europe
by attacking the neutrality of Belgium, but we were ready to fight
if they did. A fine cartoon in <i>Punch</i>, of August, 1870, shows
armed England encouraging Belgium, who stands ready with spear and
shield, with the words&mdash;'Trust me! Let us hope that they won't
trouble you, dear friend. But if they do&mdash;&mdash;' To-day they
have; and England has drawn her sword. How could she have done
otherwise, with those traditions of law so deep in all Anglo-Saxon
blood&mdash;traditions as real and as vital to Anglo-Saxon America
as to Anglo-Saxon England; traditions which are the fundamental
basis of Anglo-Saxon public life all the world over? America once
fought and beat England, in long-forgotten days, on the ground of
law. That very ground of law&mdash;that law-abidingness which is as
deeply engrained in the men of Massachusetts to-day as it is in any
Britisher&mdash;is a bond of sympathy between the two in this great
struggle of the nations.</p>
<p>To Germans our defence of public law may seem part of the moral
hypocrisy of which in their view we are full. What we are doing,
they feel, is to strike at Germany, our competitor for
'world-empire', with its dangerous navy, while Germany is engaged
in a life and death struggle with France and Russia. We too, they
feel, are Machiavellians; but we have put on what Machiavelli
called 'the mantle of superstition', the pretence of morality and
law, to cover our craft. It is true that we are fighting for our
own interest. But what is our interest? We are fighting for Right,
because Right is our supreme interest. The new German political
theory enunciates that 'our interest is our right'. The
old&mdash;the very old&mdash;English political theory is, 'The
Right is our interest'. It is true that we have everything to gain
by defending the cause of international law. Should that prevent us
from defending that cause? What do we not lose of precious lives in
the defence?</p>
<p>This is the case of England. England stands for the idea of a
public law of Europe, and for the small nations which it protects.
She stands for her own preservation, which is menaced when public
law is broken, and the 'ages' slow-bought gain' imperilled.</p>

<h2>EPILOGUE</h2>
<p>In conclusion something must be said of the process by which our
understanding with France, still so elastic in 1912 and 1913,
became the solid alliance which now, on sea and land alike,
confronts the German forces. England gave France no positive
engagements until the eleventh hour; it may be argued that England
gave them far too late, and that the war might never have occurred
if England had been less obstinately and judicially pacific. But
the English case for the delay is clear. We hesitated to throw in
our lot with France, because France would not stand neutral while
Germany made war on Russia. We shrank from the incalculable
entanglements which seemed to lie before us if we allied ourselves
with a power which was so committed. Why, we were asking ourselves,
should we fight the battles of Russia in the Balkans?</p>
<p>We were perhaps too cautious in suspecting that France might
contemplate this policy. She could not define beforehand the limits
which she would observe in defending Russia's cause. But she knew,
as we now know, that a war with Russia meant, to German statesmen,
only a pretext for a new attack on France, even more deadly in
intention than that of 1870. France could not do without the help
of Russia. How then could she afford to forfeit Russia's friendship
by declaring, at Germany's command, that she would do nothing to
help Russia?</p>
<p>This loyalty to the Dual Alliance left France during the last
days before the war in a cruel dilemma. Russia, however well
disposed, could not help her ally in the first weeks of a war; and
for France these were the critical weeks, the weeks upon which her
own fate must depend. She appealed urgently to England for
support.</p>
<p>But, even on July 31st, the English Cabinet replied that it
could make no definite engagement. This answer, it is true, had
been foreshadowed in earlier communications. Sir Edward Grey had
made it abundantly clear that there could be no prospect of common
action unless France were exposed to 'an unprovoked attack', and no
certainty of such action even in that case. But France had staked
everything upon the justice of her cause. She had felt that her
pacific intentions were clear to all the world; and that England
could not, with any self-respect, refuse assistance. The French
mobilization had been delayed until July 31st, to convince the
British Cabinet of French good faith; and the French fleet had been
left in the Mediterranean to guard the interests of England no less
than those of France. We can imagine how bitter was the
disappointment with which France received the English answer of
July 31st.</p>
<p>But we were loyal to our obligations as we understood them. If
our answers to France were guarded, our answers to the German
overtures of July 29th and August 1st show that we were fighting
the battle of France with diplomatic weapons. On August 2nd we went
still further, by undertaking to defend the French coasts and
shipping, if the German fleet should come into the Channel or
through the North Sea. To justify our position of reserve from July
31st to August 4th we may quote what Mr. Asquith said the other day
(September 4th):&mdash;</p>
<p class="blockquote">'No one who has not been in that position can
realize the strength, the energy, and the persistence with which we
laboured for peace. We persevered by every expedient that diplomacy
could suggest, straining almost to breaking-point our most
cherished friendships and obligations.'</p>
<p>Those efforts failed. We know to-day that mediation had never
any prospects of success, because Germany had resolved that it
should not succeed. Ought we to have known this from the first? It
is easy to be wise after the event. But in England we have Cabinet
government and we have Parliamentary government. Before an English
minister can act, in a matter of national importance, no matter how
positive his own convictions may be, he must convince his
colleagues, and they must feel certain of convincing a democracy
which is essentially pacific, cautious, slow to move. Nothing short
of the German attack on Belgium would have convinced the ordinary
Englishman that German statesmanship had degenerated into piracy.
That proof was given us on August 4th; and on that day we sent our
ultimatum to Berlin.</p>
<p>To-day all England is convinced; and we are fighting back to
back with the French for their national existence and our own. Our
own, because England's existence depends not only on her sea-power,
but upon the maintenance of European state-law. The military spirit
which we have described above (<a href="#CH6">Chap. VI</a>)
tramples upon the rights of nations because it sees a foe in every
equal; because it regards the prosperity of a neighbour as a
national misfortune; because it holds that national greatness is
only to be realized in the act of destroying or absorbing other
nationalities. To those who are not yet visibly assailed, and who
possibly believe themselves secure, we can only give the warning:
<i>Tua res agitur, paries cum proximus ardet</i>.</p>
<p>Of the issue England is not afraid. The most unfavourable issue
would find her still convinced that she has taken the only course
compatible with honour and with public law. Military anarchism
shall be destroyed if England, France, and Russia can destroy it.
On this object England and France have staked their last ship and
their last soldier. But, it may be asked, what state-system do we
hope to establish, if and when we are successful in this great
crusade?</p>
<p>What England not only desires but needs, and needs imperatively,
is, first, the restitution to Belgium of her former status and
whatever else can be restored of all that she has sacrificed. This
is the indispensable preliminary to any form of settlement. The
next essential is an adequate guarantee to France that she shall
never experience such another invasion as we have seen in August,
1914; without a France which is prosperous, secure, and
independent, European civilization would be irreparably maimed and
stunted. The third essential, as essential as the other two, is the
conservation of those other nations which can only exist on
sufferance so long as <i>Realpolitik</i> is practised with
impunity.</p>
<p>To minor nationalities it should be clear that England is their
friend, and cannot choose but stand their friend. Three times in
her history she has made war upon a would-be despot of the
Continent, treating the 'Balance of Power' as a principle for which
no sacrifice could be too great. In these struggles she assisted
the small Powers, less from altruism than because their interest
was her own. She supported Holland against Philip II of Spain and
against Louis XIV; against Napoleon she supported not Holland only,
but also Portugal and, to the best of her power, Switzerland and
Piedmont.</p>
<p>We do not argue&mdash;it would be absurd to argue&mdash;that
England has always been free from reproach in her dealings with the
smaller states. Holland may well remember the naval conflicts of
the seventeenth century and the English Navigation Laws. But
Holland should also remember that, in the seventeenth century,
England was not yet a great Power; Holland and England fought as
rivals and on equal terms, in a feud which subsequent alliances
have healed, over a policy which England has long since renounced
as mischievous and futile. On Denmark we inflicted a great wrong in
1807; it can only be extenuated by the fact, which Denmark knows
now though she did not know it then, that Napoleon had conspired
with Russia to seize the Danish fleet and use it against England.
Denmark, indeed, has better cause to complain that we gave her no
assistance in 1864. That mistake&mdash;for it was a mistake of
weakness, not deliberate treachery&mdash;has brought its own
nemesis. We are still paying for that particular mistake, and we
are not likely to forget the lesson. The case of Schleswig-Holstein
shows how the losses of such a state as Denmark may react on such a
state as England.</p>
<p>England cannot afford that her weaker neighbours should become
less prosperous or less independent than they are. So far as the
long arm of naval power reaches, England is bound to give them
whatever help she can. From motives of self-preservation, if on no
other ground, she could not tolerate their subordination to such a
power as Germany aspires to found. Her quarrel is not with the
German people, but with the political system for which the German
Empire, in its present temper, stands. That system England is bound
to resist, no matter by what power it is adopted.</p>
<p>English sympathies and English traditions are here at one with
English interests. England is proud to recollect how she befriended
struggling nationalities in the nineteenth century. She did not
support Greece and Italy for the sake of any help that they could
give her. The goodwill of England to Holland, to Switzerland, to
the Scandinavian states, is largely based upon their achievements
in science and art and literature. They have proved that they can
serve the higher interests of humanity. They have contributed to
the growth of that common civilization which links together the
small powers and the great with bonds more sacred and more durable
than those of race, of government, of material interest. In this
fraternity each nation has a duty to the rest. If we have harped on
England's interest, it must not for a moment be supposed that we
have forgotten England's duty. But England stands to-day in this
fortunate position, that her duty and her interest combine to impel
her in the same direction.</p>

<h2>APPENDIX I</h2>
<center>GERMANY'S REASONS FOR WAR WITH RUSSIA</center>
<p>How Russia and her Ruler betrayed Germany's confidence and
thereby made the European War.</p>
<p>WITH THE ORIGINAL TELEGRAMS AND NOTES.</p>
<p>Druck und Verlag: Liebheit &amp; Thiesen, Berlin.</p>
<p>Foreign Office,<br />
Berlin, August 1914.</p>
<p>On June 28th the Austro-Hungarian successor to the throne,
Arch-Duke Franz Ferdinand, and his wife, the Duchess of Hohenberg,
were assassinated by a member of a band of servian conspirators.
The investigation of the crime through the Austro-Hungarian
authorities has yielded the fact that the conspiracy against the
life of the Arch-Duke and successor to the throne was prepared and
abetted in Belgrade with the cooperation of Servian officials, and
executed with arms from the Servian State arsenal. This crime must
have opened the eyes of the entire civilized world, not only in
regard to the aims of the Servian policies directed against the
conservation and integrity of the Austro-Hungarian monarchy, but
also concerning the criminal means which the pan-Serb propaganda in
Servia had no hesitation in employing for the achievement of these
aims.</p>
<p>The goal of these policies was the gradual revolutionizing and
final separation of the south-easterly districts from the
Austro-Hungarian monarchy and their union with Servia. This
direction of Servias policy has not been altered in the least in
spite of the repeated and solemn declarations of Servia in which it
vouchsafed a change in these policies toward Austria-Hungary as
well as the cultivation of good and neighborly relations.</p>
<p>In this manner for the third time in the course of the last 6
years Servia has led Europe to the brink of a world-war.</p>
<p>It could only do this because it believed itself supported in
its intentions by Russia.</p>
<p>Russia soon after the events brought about by the Turkish
revolution of 1908, endeavored to found a union of the Balcan
states under Russian patronage and directed against the existence
of Turkey. This union which succeeded in 1911 in driving out Turkey
from a greater part of her European possessions, collapsed over the
question of the distribution of spoils. The Russian policies were
not dismayed over this failure. According to the idea of the
Russian statesmen a new Balcan union under Russian patronage should
be called into existence, headed no longer against Turkey, now
dislodged from the Balcan, but against the existence of the
Austro-Hungarian monarchy. It was the idea that Servia should cede
to Bulgaria those parts of Macedonia which it had received during
the last Balcan war, in exchange for Bosnia and the Herzegovina
which were to be taken from Austria. To oblige Bulgaria to fall in
with this plan it was to be isolated, Roumania attached to Russia
with the aid of French propaganda, and Servia promised Bosnia and
the Herzegovina.</p>
<p>Under these circumstances it was clear to Austria that it was
not compatible with the dignity and the spirit of self-preservation
of the monarchy to view idly any longer this agitation across the
border. The Imperial and Royal Government appraised Germany of this
conception and asked for our opinion. With all our heart we were
able to agree with our allys estimate of the situation, and assure
him that any action considered necessary to end the movement in
Servia directed against the conservation of the monarchy would meet
with our approval.</p>
<p>We were perfectly aware that a possible warlike attitude of
Austria-Hungary against Servia might bring Russia upon the field,
and that it might therefore involve us in a war, in accordance with
our duty as allies. We could not, however, in these vital interests
of Austria-Hungary, which were at stake, advise our ally to take a
yielding attitude not compatible with his dignity, nor deny him our
assistance in these trying days. We could do this all the less as
our own interests were menaced through the continued Serb
agitation. If the Serbs continued with the aid of Russia and France
to menace the existence of Austria-Hungary, the gradual collapse of
Austria and the subjection of all the Slavs under one Russian
sceptre would be the consequence, thus making untenable the
position of the Teutonic race in Central Europe. A morally weakened
Austria under the pressure of Russian pan-slavism would be no
longer an ally on whom we could count and in whom we could have
confidence, as we must be able to have, in view of the ever more
menacing attitude of our easterly and westerly neighbors. We,
therefore, permitted Austria a completely free hand in her action
towards Servia but have not participated in her preparations.</p>
<p>Austria chose the method of presenting to the Servian Government
a note, in which the direct connection between the murder at
Sarajevo and the pan-Serb movement, as not only countenanced but
actively supported by the Servian Government, was explained, and in
which a complete cessation of this agitation, as well as a
punishment of the guilty, was requested. At the same time
Austria-Hungary demanded as necessary guarantee for the
accomplishment of her desire the participation of some Austrian
officials in the preliminary examination on Servian territory and
the final dissolution of the pan-Serb societies agitating against
Austria-Hungary. The Imperial and Royal Government gave a period of
48 hours for the unconditional acceptance of its demands.</p>
<p>The Servian Government started the mobilization of its army one
day after the transmission of the Austro-Hungarian note.</p>
<p>As after the stipulated date the Servian Government rendered a
reply which, though complying in some points with the conditions of
Austria-Hungary, yet showed in all essentials the endeavor through
procrastination and new negotiations to escape from the just
demands of the monarchy, the latter discontinued her diplomatic
relations with Servia without indulging in further negotiations or
accepting further Servian assurances, whose value, to its loss, she
had sufficiently experienced.</p>
<p>From this moment Austria was in fact in a state of war with
Servia, which it proclaimed officially on the 28th of July by
declaring war.</p>
<p>[Sidenote: see exhibits 1 &amp; 2.]</p>
<p>From the beginning of the conflict we assumed the position that
there were here concerned the affairs of Austria alone, which it
would have to settle with Servia. We therefore directed our efforts
toward the localizing of the war, and toward convincing the other
powers that Austria-Hungary had to appeal to arms in justifiable
self-defence, forced upon her by the conditions. We emphatically
took the position that no civilized country possessed the right to
stay the arm of Austria in this struggle with barbarism and
political crime, and to shield the Servians against their just
punishment. In this sense we instructed our representatives with
the foreign powers.</p>
<p>[Sidenote: see exhibit 3.]</p>
<p>Simultaneously the Austro-Hungarian Government communicated to
the Russian Government that the step undertaken against Servia
implied merely a defensive measure against the Serb agitation, but
that Austria-Hungary must of necessity demand guarantees for a
continued friendly behavior of Servia towards the monarchy.
Austria-Hungary had no intention whatsoever to shift the balance of
power in the Balcan.</p>
<p>In answer to our declaration that the German Government desired,
and aimed at, a localization of the conflict, both the French and
the English Governments promised an action in the same direction.
But these endeavors did not succeed in preventing the interposition
of Russia in the Austro-Servian disagreement.</p>
<p>[Sidenote: see exhibits 4 &amp; 5.]</p>
<p>The Russian Government submitted an official communiqu&eacute;
on July 24th, according to which Russia could not possibly remain
indifferent in the Servio-Austrian conflict. The same was declared
by the Russian Secretary of Foreign Affairs, M. Sasonow, to the
German Ambassador, Count Pourtal&egrave;s, in the afternoon of July
26th. The German Government declared again, through its Ambassador
at St. Petersburg, that Austria-Hungary had no desire for conquest
and only wished peace at her frontiers. After the official
explanation by Austria-Hungary to Russia that it did not claim
territorial gain in Servia, the decision concerning the peace of
the world rested exclusively with St. Petersburg.</p>
<p>[Sidenote: see exhibits 6, 7, 8, 9.]</p>
<p>The same day the first news of Russian mobilization reached
Berlin in the evening.</p>
<p>[Sidenote: see exhibits 10, 10a, 10b.]</p>
<p>The German Ambassadors at London, Paris, and St. Petersburg were
instructed to energetically point out the danger of this Russian
mobilization. The Imperial Ambassador at St. Petersburg was also
directed to make the following declaration to the Russian
Government:</p>
<p class="blockquote">"Preparatory military measures by Russia will
force us to counter-measures which must consist in mobilizing the
army.</p>
<p class="blockquote">"But mobilization means war.</p>
<p class="blockquote">"As we know the obligations of France towards
Russia, this mobilization would be directed against both Russia and
France. We cannot assume that Russia desires to unchain such a
European war. Since Austria-Hungary will not touch the existence of
the Servian kingdom, we are of the opinion that Russia can afford
to assume an attitude of waiting. We can all the more support the
desire of Russia to protect the integrity of Servia as
Austria-Hungary does not intend to question the latter. It will be
easy in the further development of the affair to find a basis for
an understanding."</p>
<p>[Sidenote: see exhibit 11.]</p>
<p>On July 27th the Russian Secretary of War, M. Ssuchomlinow, gave
the German military attach&eacute; his word of honor that no order
to mobilize had been issued, merely preparations were being made,
but not a horse mustered, nor reserves called in. If
Austria-Hungary crossed the Servian frontier, the military
districts directed towards Austria, i.e. Kiev, Odessa, Moscow,
Kazan, would be mobilized, under no circumstances those situated on
the German frontier, i.e. St. Petersburg, Vilna, and Warsaw. Upon
inquiry into the object of the mobilization against
Austria-Hungary, the Russian Minister of War replied by shrugging
his shoulders and referring to the diplomats. The military
attach&eacute; then pointed to these mobilization measures against
Austria-Hungary as extremely menacing also for Germany.</p>
<p>In the succeeding days news concerning Russian mobilization came
at a rapid rate. Among it was also news about preparations on the
German-Russian frontier, as for instance the announcement of the
state of war in Kovno, the departure of the Warsaw garrison, and
the strengthening of the Alexandrovo garrison.</p>
<p>On July 27th, the first information was received concerning
preparatory measures taken by France: the 14th Corps discontinued
the manoeuvres and returned to its garrison.</p>
<p>In the meantime we had endeavored to localize the conflict by
most emphatic steps.</p>
<p>[Sidenote: see exhibit 12.]</p>
<p>On July 26th, Sir Edward Grey had made the proposal to submit
the differences between Austria-Hungary and Servia to a conference
of the Ambassadors of Germany, France, and Italy under his
chairmanship. We declared in regard to this proposal that we could
not, however much we approved the idea, participate in such a
conference, as we could not call Austria in her dispute with Servia
before a European tribunal.</p>
<p>France consented to the proposal of Sir Edward Grey, but it
foundered upon Austria's declining it, as was to be expected.</p>
<p>[Sidenote: see exhibit 13.]</p>
<p>Faithful to our principle that mediation should not extend to
the Austro-Servian conflict, which is to be considered as a purely
Austro-Hungarian affair, but merely to the relations between
Austria-Hungary and Russia, we continued our endeavors to bring
about an understanding between these two powers.</p>
<p>[Sidenote: see exhibits 15 &amp; 16.]</p>
<p>We further declared ourselves ready, after failure of the
conference idea, to transmit a second proposal of Sir Edward Grey's
to Vienna in which he suggested Austria-Hungary should decide that
either the Servian reply was sufficient, or that it be used as a
basis for further negotiations. The Austro-Hungarian Government
remarked with full appreciation of our action that it had come too
late, the hostilities having already been opened.</p>
<p>In spite of this we continued our attempts to the utmost, and we
advised Vienna to show every possible advance compatible with the
dignity of the monarchy.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, all these proposals were overtaken by the
military preparations of Russia and France.</p>
<p>[Sidenote: see exhibit 17.]</p>
<p>On July 29th, the Russian Government made the official
notification in Berlin that four army districts had been mobilized.
At the same time further news was received concerning rapidly
progressing military preparations of France, both on water and on
land.</p>
<p>On the same day the Imperial Ambassador in St. Petersburg had an
interview with the Russian Foreign Secretary, in regard to which he
reported by telegraph, as follows:</p>
<p class="blockquote">"The Secretary tried to persuade me that I
should urge my Government to participate in a quadruple conference
to find means to induce Austria-Hungary to give up those demands
which touch upon the sovereignty of Servia. I could merely promise
to report the conversation and took the position that, after Russia
had decided upon the baneful step of mobilization, every exchange
of ideas appeared now extremely difficult, if not impossible.
Besides, Russia now was demanding from us in regard to
Austria-Hungary the same which Austria-Hungary was being blamed for
with regard to Servia, i.e. an infraction of sovereignty.
Austria-Hungary having promised to consider the Russian interests
by disclaiming any territorial aspiration,&mdash;a great concession
on the part of a state engaged in war&mdash;should therefore be
permitted to attend to its affair with Servia alone. There would be
time at the peace conference to return to the matter of forbearance
towards the sovereignty of Servia.</p>
<p class="blockquote">"I added very solemnly that at this moment
the entire Austro-Servian affair was eclipsed by the danger of a
general European conflagration, and I endeavored to present to the
Secretary the magnitude of this danger.</p>
<p class="blockquote">"It was impossible to dissuade Sasonow from
the idea that Servia could not now be deserted by Russia".</p>
<p>On July 29th, the German Military Attache at St. Petersburg
wired the following report on a conversation with the Chief of the
General Staff of the Russian army:</p>
<p class="blockquote">"The Chief of the General Staff has asked me
to call on him, and he has told me that he has just come from His
Majesty. He has been requested by the Secretary of War to reiterate
once more that everything had remained as the Secretary had
informed me two days ago. He offered confirmation in writing and
gave me his word of honor in the most solemn manner that nowhere
there had been a mobilization, viz. calling in of a single man or
horse up to the present time, i.e. 3 o'clock in the afternoon. He
could not assume a guaranty for the future, but he could emphasize
that in the fronts directed towards our frontiers His Majesty
desired no mobilization.</p>
<p class="blockquote">"As, however, I had received here many pieces
of news concerning the calling in of the reserves in different
parts of the country also in Warsaw and in Vilna, I told the
general that his statements placed me before a riddle. On his
officers word of honor he replied that such news was wrong, but
that possibly here and there a false alarm might have been
given.</p>
<p class="blockquote">"I must consider this conversation as an
attempt to mislead us as to the extent of the measures hitherto
taken in view of the abundant and positive information about the
calling in of reserves."</p>
<p>In reply to various inquiries concerning reasons for its
threatening attitude, the Russian Government repeatedly pointed out
that Austria-Hungary had commenced no conversation in St.
Petersburg. The Austro-Hungarian Ambassador in St. Petersburg was
therefore instructed on July 29th, at our suggestion, to enter into
such conversation with Sasonow. Count Sz&aacute;p&aacute;ry was
empowered to explain to the Russian minister the note to Servia
though it had been overtaken by the state of war, and to accept any
suggestion on the part of Russia as well as to discuss with Sasonow
all questions touching directly upon the Austro-Russian
relations.</p>
<p>[Sidenote: see exhibit 19.]</p>
<p>Shoulder to shoulder with England we labored incessantly and
supported every proposal in Vienna from which we hoped to gain the
possibility of a peaceable solution of the conflict. We even as
late as the 30th of July forwarded the English proposal to Vienna,
as basis for negotiations, that Austria-Hungary should dictate her
conditions in Servia, i.e. after her march into Servia. We thought
that Russia would accept this basis.</p>
<p>During the interval from July 29th to July 31st there appeared
renewed and cumulative news concerning Russian measures of
mobilization. Accumulation of troops on the East Prussian frontier
and the declaration of the state of war over all important parts of
the Russian west frontier allowed no further doubt that the Russian
mobilization was in full swing against us, while simultaneously all
such measures were denied to our representative in St. Petersburg
on word of honor.</p>
<p>Nay, even before the reply from Vienna regarding the
Anglo-German mediation whose tendencies and basis must have been
known in St. Petersburg, could possibly have been received in
Berlin, Russia ordered a general mobilization.</p>
<p>[Sidenote: see exhibits 18, 20, 21, 22, 23.]</p>
<p>During the same days, there took place between His Majesty the
Kaiser, and Czar Nicolas an exchange of telegrams in which His
Majesty called the attention of the Czar to the menacing character
of the Russian mobilization during the continuance of his own
mediating activities.</p>
<p>On July 31st, the Czar directed the following telegram to His
Majesty the Kaiser:</p>
<p class="blockquote">"I thank You cordially for Your mediation
which permits the hope that everything may yet end peaceably. It is
technically impossible to discontinue our military preparations
which have been made necessary by the Austrian mobilization. It is
far from us to want war. As long as the negotiations between
Austria and Servia continue, my troops will undertake no
provocative action. I give You my solemn word thereon. I confide
with all my faith in the grace of God, and I hope for the success
of Your mediation in Vienna for the welfare of our countries and
the peace of Europe.</p>
<p class="blockquote">"Your cordially devoted</p>
<p class="blockquote">"Nicolas."</p>
<p>This telegram of the Czar crossed with the following, sent by
H.M. the Kaiser, also on July 31st, at 2 p.m.:</p>
<p class="blockquote">"Upon Your appeal to my friendship and Your
request for my aid I have engaged in mediation between Your
Government and the Government of Austria-Hungary. While this action
was taking place, Your troops were being mobilized against my ally
Austria-Hungary, whereby, as I have already communicated to You, my
mediation has become almost illusory. In spite of this, I have
continued it, and now I receive reliable news that serious
preparations for war are going on on my eastern frontier. The
responsibility for the security of my country forces me to measures
of defence. I have gone to the extreme limit of the possible in my
efforts for the preservation of the peace of the world. It is not I
who bear the responsibility for the misfortune which now threatens
the entire civilized world. It rests in Your hand to avert it. No
one threatens the honor and peace of Russia which might well have
awaited the success of my mediation. The friendship for You and
Your country, bequeathed to me by my grand-father on his deathbed,
has always been sacred to me, and I have stood faithfully by Russia
while it was in serious affliction, especially during its last war.
The peace of Europe can still be preserved by You if Russia decides
to discontinue those military preparations which menace Germany and
Austria-Hungary."</p>
<p>Before this telegram reached its destination, the mobilization
of all the Russian forces, obviously directed against us and
already ordered during the afternoon of the 31st of July, was in
full swing. Notwithstanding, the telegram of the Czar was sent at 2
o'clock that same afternoon.</p>
<p>[Sidenote: see exhibit 24.]</p>
<p>After the Russian general mobilization became known in Berlin,
the Imperial Ambassador at St. Petersburg was instructed on the
afternoon of July 31st to explain to the Russian Government that
Germany declared the state of war as counter-measure against the
general mobilization of the Russian army and navy which must be
followed by mobilization if Russia did not cease its military
measures against Germany and Austria-Hungary within 12 hours, and
notified Germany thereof.</p>
<p>[Sidenote: see exhibit 25.]</p>
<p>At the same time the Imperial Ambassador in Paris was instructed
to demand from the French Government a declaration within 18 hours,
whether it would remain neutral in a Russo-German war.</p>
<p>The Russian Government destroyed through its mobilization,
menacing the security of our country, the laborious action at
mediation of the European cabinets. The Russian mobilization in
regard to the seriousness of which the Russian Government was never
allowed by us to entertain a doubt, in connection with its
continued denial, shows clearly that Russia wanted war.</p>
<p>The Imperial Ambassador at St. Petersburg delivered his note to
M. Sasonow on July 31st at 12 o'clock midnight.</p>
<p>The reply of the Russian Government has never reached us.</p>
<p>Two hours after the expiration of the time limit the Czar
telegraphed to H.M. the Kaiser, as follows:</p>
<p class="blockquote">"I have received Your telegram. I comprehend
that You are forced to mobilize, but I should like to have from You
the same guaranty which I have given You, viz., that these measures
do not mean war, and that we shall continue to negotiate for the
welfare of our two countries and the universal peace which is so
dear to our hearts. With the aid of God it must be possible to our
long tried friendship to prevent the shedding of blood. I expect
with full confidence Your urgent reply."</p>
<p>To this H.M. the Kaiser replied:</p>
<p class="blockquote">"I thank You for Your telegram. I have shown
yesterday to Your Government the way through which alone war may
yet be averted. Although I asked for a reply by to-day noon, no
telegram from my Ambassador has reached me with the reply of Your
Government. I therefore have been forced to mobilize my army. An
immediate, clear and unmistakable reply of Your Government is the
sole way to avoid endless misery. Until I receive this reply I am
unable, to my great grief, to enter upon the subject of Your
telegram. I must ask most earnestly that You, without delay, order
Your troops to commit, under no circumstances, the slightest
violation of our frontiers."</p>
<p>As the time limit given to Russia had expired without the
receipt of a reply to our inquiry, H.M. the Kaiser ordered the
mobilization of the entire German Army and Navy on August 1st at 5
p.m.</p>
<p>[Sidenote: see exhibit 25.]</p>
<p>The German Ambassador at St. Petersburg was instructed that, in
the event of the Russian Government not giving a satisfactory reply
within the stipulated time, he should declare that we considered
ourselves in a state of war after the refusal of our demands.
However, before a confirmation of the execution of this order had
been received, that is to say, already in the afternoon of August
1st, i.e., the same afternoon on which the telegram of the Czar,
cited above, was sent, Russian troops crossed our frontier and
marched into German territory.</p>
<p>Thus Russia began the war against us.</p>
<p>Meanwhile the Imperial Ambassador in Paris put our question to
the French Cabinet on July 31st at 7 p.m.</p>
<p>[Sidenote: see exhibit 27.]</p>
<p>The French Prime Minister gave an equivocal and unsatisfactory
reply on August 1st at 1. p.m. which gave no clear idea of the
position of France, as he limited himself to the explanation that
France would do that which her interests demanded. A few hours
later, at 5 p.m., the mobilization of the entire French army and
navy was ordered.</p>
<p>On the morning of the next day France opened hostilities.</p>
<center>THE ORIGINAL TELEGRAMS AND NOTES.</center>
<center>THE NOTE OF AUSTRIA-HUNGARY TO SERVIA.</center>
<p>Presented July 23rd in Belgrade.</p>
<p>"On March 31st, 1909, the Royal Servian Minister to the Court of
Vienna made the following statement, by order of his
Government:</p>
<p>"Servia declares that she is not affected in her rights by the
situation established in Bosnia, and that she will therefore adapt
herself to the decisions which the powers are going to arrive at in
reference to Art. 25 of the Berlin Treaty. By following the
councils of the powers, Servia binds herself to cease the attitude
of protest and resistence which she has assumed since last October,
relative to the annexation, and she binds herself further to change
the direction of her present policies towards Austria-Hungary, and,
in the future, to live with the latter in friendly and neighborly
relations.</p>
<p>"The history of the last years, and especially the painful
events of June 28th, have demonstrated the existence of a
subversive movement in Servia whose aim it is to separate certain
territories from the Austro-Hungarian monarchy. This movement,
which developed under the eyes of the Servian Government, has found
expression subsequently beyond the territory of the kingdom, in
acts of terrorism, a series of assassinations and murders.</p>
<p>"Far from fulfilling the formal obligations contained in the
declaration of March 31st, 1909, the Royal Servian Government has
done nothing to suppress this movement. She suffered the criminal
doings of the various societies and associations directed against
the monarchy, the unbridled language of the press, the
glorification of the originators of assassinations, the
participation of officers and officials in subversive intrigues;
she suffered the unwholesome propaganda in public education, and
lastly permitted all manifestations which would mislead the Servian
people into hatred of the monarchy and into contempt for its
institutions.</p>
<p>"This sufferance of which the Royal Servian Government made
itself guilty, has lasted up to the moment in which the events of
June 28th demonstrated to the entire world the ghastly consequences
of such sufferance.</p>
<p>"<i>It becomes plain from the evidence and confessions of the
criminal authors of the outrage of June 28th, that the murder at
Sarajevo was conceived in Belgrade, that the murderers received the
arms and bombs with which they were equipped, from Servian officers
and officials who belonged to the Narodna Odbrana, and that,
lastly, the transportation of the criminals and their arms to
Bosnia was arranged and carried out by leading Servian frontier
officials.</i></p>
<p>"The cited results of the investigation do not permit the
Imperial and Royal Government to observe any longer the attitude of
waiting, which it has assumed for years towards those agitations
which have their centre in Belgrade, and which from there radiate
into the territory of the monarchy. These results, on the contrary,
impose upon the Imperial and Royal Government the duty to terminate
intrigues which constitute a permanent menace for the peace of the
monarchy.</p>
<p>"In order to obtain this purpose, the Imperial and Royal
Government is forced to demand official assurance from the Servian
Government that it condemns the propaganda directed against
Austria-Hungary, i.e. the entirety of the machinations whose aim it
is to separate parts from the monarchy which belong to it, and that
she binds herself to suppress with all means this criminal and
terrorizing propaganda.</p>
<p>"In order to give to these obligations a solemn character, the
Royal Servian Government will publish on the first page of its
official organ of July 26th, 1914, the following declaration:</p>
<p>"The Royal Servian Government condemns the propaganda directed
against Austria-Hungary, i.e. the entirety of those machinations
whose aim it is to separate from the Austro-Hungarian monarchy
territories belonging thereto, and she regrets sincerely the
ghastly consequences of these criminal actions.</p>
<p>"The Royal Servian Government regrets that Servian officers and
officials have participated in the propaganda, cited above, and
have thus threatened the friendly and neighborly relations which
the Royal Government was solemnly bound to cultivate by its
declaration of March 31st, 1909.</p>
<p>"The Royal Government which disapproves and rejects every
thought or every attempt at influencing the destinations of the
inhabitants of any part of Austria-Hungary, considers it its duty
to call most emphatically to the attention of its officers and
officials, and of the entire population of the kingdom, that it
will hence-forward proceed with the utmost severity against any
persons guilty of similar actions, to prevent and suppress which it
will make every effort."</p>
<p>"This explanation is to be brought simultaneously to the
cognizance of the Royal Army through an order of H.M. the King, and
it is to be published in the official organ of the Army.</p>
<p>"The Royal Servian Government binds itself, in addition, as
follows:</p>
<p>"1. to suppress any publication which fosters hatred of, and
contempt for, the Austro-Hungarian monarchy, and whose general
tendency is directed against the latters territorial integrity;</p>
<p>"2. to proceed at once with the dissolution of the society
Narodna Odbrana, to confiscate their entire means of propaganda,
and to proceed in the same manner against the other societies and
associations in Servia which occupy themselves with the propaganda
against Austria-Hungary. The Royal Government will take the
necessary measures, so that the dissolved societies may not
continue their activities under another name or in another
form;</p>
<p>"3. without delay to eliminate from the public instruction in
Servia, so far as the corps of instructors, as well as the means of
instruction are concerned, that which serves, or may serve, to
foster the propaganda against Austria-Hungary;</p>
<p>"4. to remove from military service and the administration in
general all officers and officials who are guilty of propaganda
against Austria-Hungary, and whose names, with a communication of
the material which the Imperial and Royal Government possesses
against them, the Imperial and Royal Government reserves the right
to communicate to the Royal Government;</p>
<p>"5. to consent that in Servia officials of the Imperial and
Royal Government co-operate in the suppression of a movement
directed against the territorial integrity of the monarchy;</p>
<p>"6. to commence a judicial investigation against the
participants of the conspiracy of June 28th, who are on Servian
territory. Officials, delegated by the Imperial and Royal
Government will participate in the examinations;</p>
<p>"7. to proceed at once with all severity to arrest Major Voja
Tankosic and a certain Milan Ciganowic, Servian State officials,
who have been compromised through the result of the
investigation;</p>
<p>"8. to prevent through effective measures the participation of
the Servian authorities in the smuggling of arms and explosives
across the frontier and to dismiss those officials of Shabatz and
Loznica, who assisted the originators of the crime of Sarajevo in
crossing the frontier;</p>
<p>"9. to give to the Imperial and Royal Government explanations in
regard to the unjustifiable remarks of high Servian functionaries
in Servia and abroad who have not hesitated, in spite of their
official position, to express themselves in interviews in a hostile
manner against Austria-Hungary after the outrage of June 28th;</p>
<p>"10. The Imperial and Royal Government expects a reply from the
Royal Government at the latest until Saturday 25th inst., at 6 p.m.
A memoir concerning the results of the investigations at Sarajevo,
so far as they concern points 7. and 8. is enclosed with this
note."</p>
<p>ENCLOSURE.</p>
<p>The investigation carried on against Gabrilo Princip and
accomplices in the Court of Sarajevo, on account of the
assassination on June 28th has, so far, yielded the following
results:</p>
<p>1. The plan to murder Arch-Duke Franz Ferdinand during his stay
in Sarajevo was conceived in Belgrade by Gabrilo Princip, Nedeljko,
Gabrinowic, and a certain Milan Ciganowic and Trifko Grabez, with
the aid of Major Voja Tankosic.</p>
<p>2. The six bombs and four Browning pistols which were used by
the criminals, were obtained by Milan Ciganowic and Major Tankosic,
and presented to Princip Gabrinowic in Belgrade.</p>
<p>3. The bombs are hand grenades, manufactured at the arsenal of
the Servian Army in Kragujevac.</p>
<p>4. To insure the success of the assassination, Milan Ciganowic
instructed Princip Gabrinowic in the use of the grenades and gave
instructions in shooting with Browning pistols to Princip Grabez in
a forest near the target practice field of Topshider&mdash;(outside
Belgrade).</p>
<p>5. In order to enable the crossing of the frontier of Bosnia and
Herzegovina by Princip Gabrinowic and Grabez, and the smuggling of
their arms, a secret system of transportation was organized by
Ciganowic. The entry of the criminals with their arms into Bosnia
and Herzegovina was effected by the frontier captains of Shabatz
(Rade Popowic) and of Loznica, as well as by the custom house
official Rudivoy Grbic of Loznica with the aid of several other
persons.</p>
<center>THE SERVIAN ANSWER.</center>
<p>Presented at Vienna, July 25th, 1914.<br />
(With Austria's commentaries in italics.)</p>
<p>The Royal Government has received the communication of the
Imperial and Royal Government of the 23rd inst. and is convinced
that its reply will dissipate any misunderstanding which threatens
to destroy the friendly and neighborly relations between the
Austrian monarchy and the kingdom of Servia.</p>
<p>The Royal Government is conscious that nowhere there have been
renewed protests against the great neighborly monarchy like those
which at one time were expressed in the Skuptschina, as well as in
the declaration and actions of the responsible representatives of
the state at that time, and which were terminated by the Servian
declaration of March 31st 1909; furthermore that since that time
neither the different corporations of the kingdom, nor the
officials have made an attempt to alter the political and judicial
condition created in Bosnia and the Herzegovina. The Royal
Government states that the I. and R. Government has made no
protestation in this sense excepting in the case of a text book, in
regard to which the I. and R. Government has received an entirely
satisfactory explanation. Servia has given during the time of the
Balcan crisis in numerous cases evidence of her pacific and
moderate policy, and it is only owing to Servia and the sacrifices
which she has brought in the interest of the peace of Europe that
this peace has been preserved.</p>
<p><i>The Royal Servian Government limits itself to establishing
that since the declaration of March 31st 1909, there has been no
attempt on the part of the Servian Government to alter the position
of Bosnia and the Herzegovina.</i></p>
<p><i>With this she deliberately shifts the foundation of our note,
as we have not insisted that she and her officials have undertaken
anything official in this direction. Our gravamen is that in spite
of the obligation assumed in the cited note, she has omitted to
suppress the movement directed against the territorial integrity of
the monarchy.</i></p>
<p><i>Her obligation consisted in changing her attitude and the
entire direction of her policies, and in entering into friendly and
neighborly relations with the Austro-Hungarian monarchy, and not
only not to interfere with the possession of Bosnia.</i></p>
<p>The Royal Government cannot be made responsible for expressions
of a private character, as for instance newspaper articles and the
peaceable work of societies, expressions which are of very common
appearance in other countries, and which ordinarily are not under
the control of the state. This, all the less, as the Royal
Government has shown great courtesy in the solution of a whole
series of questions which have arisen between Servia and
Austria-Hungary, whereby it has succeeded to solve the greater
number thereof, in favor of the progress of both countries.</p>
<p><i>The assertion of the Royal Servian Government that the
expressions of the press and the activity of Servian associations
possess a private character and thus escape governmental control,
stands in full contrast with the institutions of modern states and
even the most liberal of press and society laws, which nearly
everywhere subject the press and the societies to a certain control
of the state. This is also provided for by the Servian
institutions. The rebuke against the Servian Government consists in
the fact that it has totally omitted to supervise its press and its
societies, in so far as it knew their direction to be hostile to
the monarchy.</i></p>
<p>The Royal Government was therefore painfully surprised by the
assertions that citizens of Servia had participated in the
preparations of the outrage in Sarajevo. The Government expected to
be invited to cooperate in the investigation of the crime, and it
was ready in order to prove its complete correctness, to proceed
against all persons in regard to whom it would receive
information.</p>
<p><i>This assertion is incorrect. The Servian Government was
accurately informed about the suspicion resting upon quite definite
personalities and not only in the position, but also obliged by its
own laws to institute investigations spontaneously. The Servian
Government has done nothing in this direction.</i></p>
<p>According to the wishes of the I. and R. Government, the Royal
Government is prepared to surrender to the court, without regard to
position and rank, every Servian citizen, for whose participation
in the crime of Sarajevo it should have received proof. It binds
itself particularly on the first page of the official organ of the
26th of July to publish the following enunciation:</p>
<p>"The Royal Servian Government condemns every propaganda which
should be directed against Austria-Hungary, i. e. the entirety of
such activities as aim towards the separation of certain
territories from the Austro-Hungarian monarchy, and it regrets
sincerely the lamentable consequences of these criminal
machinations."</p>
<p><i>The Austrian demand reads</i>:</p>
<p>"<i>The Royal Servian Government condemns the propaganda against
Austria-Hungary</i>...."</p>
<p><i>The alteration of the declaration as demanded by us, which
has been made by the Royal Servian Government, is meant to imply
that a propaganda directed against Austria-Hungary does not exist,
and that it is not aware of such. This formula is insincere, and
the Servian Government reserves itself the supterfuge for later
occasions that it had not disavowed by this declaration the
existing propaganda, nor recognized the same as hostile to the
monarchy, whence it could deduce further that it is not obliged to
suppress in the future a propaganda similar to the present
one</i>.</p>
<p>The Royal Government regrets that according to a communication
of the I. and R. Government certain Servian officers and
functionaries have participated in the propaganda just referred to,
and that these have therefore endangered the amicable relations for
the observation of which the Royal Government had solemnly obliged
itself through the declaration of March 31st, 1909.</p>
<p>The Government ... identical with the demanded text.</p>
<p><i>The formula as demanded by Austria reads</i>:</p>
<p>"<i>The Royal Government regrets that Servian officers and
functionaries ... have participated</i>...."</p>
<p><i>Also with this formula and the further addition "according to
the declaration of the I. and R. Government", the Servian
Government pursues the object, already indicated above, to preserve
a free hand for the future</i>.</p>
<p>The Royal Government binds itself further:</p>
<p>1. During the next regular meeting of the Skuptschina to embody
in the press laws a clause, to wit, that the incitement to hatred
of, and contempt for, the monarchy is to be must severely punished,
as well as every publication whose general tendency is directed
against the territorial integrity of Austria-Hungary.</p>
<p>It binds itself in view of the coming revision of the
constitution to embody an amendment into Art. 22 of the
constitutional law which permits the confiscation of such
publications as is at present impossible according to the clear
definition of Art. 22 of the constitution.</p>
<p><i>Austria had demanded</i>:</p>
<p><i>1. To suppress every publication which incites to hatred and
contempt for the monarchy, and whose tendency is directed against
the territorial integrity of the monarchy.</i></p>
<p><i>We wanted to bring about the obligation for Servia to take
care that such attacks of the press would cease in the
future.</i></p>
<p><i>Instead Servia offers to pass certain laws which are meant as
means towards this end, viz.:</i></p>
<p><i>a) A law according to which the expressions of the press
hostile to the monarchy can be individually punished, a matter,
which is immaterial to us, all the more so, as the individual
prosecution of press intrigues is very rarely possible and as, with
a lax enforcement of such laws, the few cases of this nature would
not be punished. The proposition, therefore, does not meet our
demand in any way, and it offers not the least guarantee for the
desired success.</i></p>
<p><i>b) An amendment to Art. 22 of the constitution, which would
permit confiscation, a proposal, which does not satisfy us, as the
existence of such a law in Servia is of no use to us. For we want
the obligation of the Government to enforce it and that has not
been promised us.</i></p>
<p><i>These proposals are therefore entirely unsatisfactory and
evasive as we are not told within what time these laws will be
passed, and as in the event of the notpassing of these laws by the
Skuptschina everything would remain as it is, excepting the event
of a possible resignation of the Government.</i></p>
<p>2. The Government possesses no proofs and the note of the I. and
R. Government does not submit them that the society Narodna Odbrana
and other similar societies have committed, up to the present, any
criminal actions of this manner through anyone of their members.
Notwithstanding this, the Royal Government will accept the demand
of the I. and R. Government and dissolve the society Narodna
Odbrana, as well as every society which should act against
Austria-Hungary.</p>
<p><i>The propaganda of the Narodna Odbrana and affiliated
societies hostile to the monarchy fills the entire public life of
Servia; it is therefore an entirely inacceptable reserve if the
Servian Government asserts that it knows nothing about it. Aside
from this, our demand is not completely fulfilled, as we have asked
besides:</i></p>
<p>"<i>To confiscate the means of propaganda of these societies to
prevent the reformation of the dissolved societies under another
name and in another form.</i>"</p>
<p><i>In these two directions the Belgrade Cabinet is perfectly
silent, so that through this semi-concession there is offered us no
guarantee for putting an end to the agitation of the associations
hostile to the Monarchy, especially the Narodna Odbrana.</i></p>
<p>3. The Royal Servian Government binds itself without delay to
eliminate from the public instruction in Servia anything which
might further the propaganda directed against Austria-Hungary
provided the I. and R. Government furnishes actual proofs.</p>
<p><i>Also in this case the Servian Government first demands proofs
for a propaganda hostile to the Monarchy in the public instruction
of Servia while it must know that the text books introduced in the
Servian schools contain objectionable matter in this direction and
that a large portion of the teachers are in the camp of the Narodna
Odbrana and affiliated societies.</i></p>
<p><i>Furthermore, the Servian Government has not fulfilled a part
of our demands, as we have requested, as it omitted in its text the
addition desired by us: "as far as the body of instructors is
concerned, as well as the means of instruction"&mdash;a sentence
which shows clearly where the propaganda hostile to the Monarchy is
to be found in the Servian schools</i>.</p>
<p>4. The Royal Government is also ready to dismiss those officers
and officials from the military and civil services in regard to
whom it has been proved by judicial investigation that they have
been guilty of actions against the territorial integrity of the
monarchy; it expects that the I. and R. Government communicate to
it for the purpose of starting the investigation the names of these
officers and officials, and the facts with which they have been
charged.</p>
<p><i>By promising the dismissal from the military and civil
services of those officers and officials who are found guilty by
judicial procedure, the Servian Government limits its assent to
those cases, in which these persons have been charged with a crime
according to the statutory code. As, however, we demand the removal
of such officers and officials as indulge in a propaganda hostile
to the Monarchy, which is generally not punishable in Servia, our
demands have not been fulfilled in this point</i>.</p>
<p>5. The Royal Government confesses that it is not clear about the
sense and the scope of that demand of the I. and R. Government
which concerns the obligation on the part of the Royal Servian
Government to permit the cooperation of officials of the I. and R.
Government on Servian territory, but it declares that it is willing
to accept every cooperation which does not run counter to
international law and criminal law, as well as to the friendly and
neighborly relations.</p>
<p><i>The international law, as well as the criminal law, has
nothing to do with this question; it is purely a matter of the
nature of state police which is to be solved by way of a special
agreement. The reserved attitude of Servia is therefore
incomprehensible and on account of its vague general form it would
lead to unbridgeable difficulties</i>.</p>
<p>6. The Royal Government considers it its duty as a matter of
course to begin an investigation against all those persons who have
participated in the outrage of June 28th and who are in its
territory. As far as the cooperation in this investigation of
specially delegated officials of the I. and R. Government is
concerned, this cannot be accepted, as this is a violation of the
constitution and of criminal procedure. Yet in some cases the
result of the investigation might be communicated to the
Austro-Hungarian officials.</p>
<p><i>The Austrian demand was clear and unmistakable</i>:</p>
<p><i>1. To institute a criminal procedure against the participants
in the outrage</i>.</p>
<p><i>2. Participation by I. and R. Government officials in the
examinations ("Recherche" in contrast with "enqu&ecirc;te
judiciaire").</i></p>
<p><i>3. It did not occur to us to let I. and R. Government
officials participate in the Servian court procedure; they were to
cooperate only in the police researches which had to furnish and
fix the material for the investigation.</i></p>
<p><i>If the Servian Government misunderstands us here, this is
done deliberately, for it must be familiar with the difference
between "enqu&ecirc;te judiciaire" and simple police researches. As
it desired to escape from every control of the investigation which
would yield, if correctly carried out, highly undesirable results
for it, and as it possesses no means to refuse in a plausible
manner the cooperation of our officials (precedents for such police
intervention exist in great number) it tries to justify its refusal
by showing up our demands as impossible</i>.</p>
<p>7. The Royal Government has ordered on the evening of the day on
which the note was received the arrest of Major Voislar Tankosic.
However, as far as Milan Ciganowic is concerned who is a citizen of
the Austro-Hungarian Monarchy and who has been employed till June
28th with the Railroad Department, it has as yet been impossible to
locate him, wherefor a warrant has been issued against him.</p>
<p>The I. and R. Government is asked to make known, as soon as
possible, for the purpose of conducting the investigation, the
existing grounds for suspicion and the proofs of guilt, obtained in
the investigation at Sarajevo.</p>
<p><i>This reply is disingenuous. According to our investigation,
Ciganowic, by order of the police prefect in Belgrade, left three
days after the outrage for Ribari, after it had become known that
Ciganowic had participated in the outrage. In the first place, it
is therefore incorrect that Ciganowic left the Servian service on
June 28th. In the second place, we add that the prefect of police
at Belgrade who had himself caused the departure of this Ciganowic
and who knew his whereabout, declared in an interview that a man by
the name of Milan Ciganowic did not exist in Belgrade</i>.</p>
<p>8. The Servian Government will amplify and render more severe
the existing measures against the suppression of smuggling of arms
and explosives.</p>
<p>It is a matter of course that it will proceed at once against,
and punish severely, those officials of the frontier service on the
line Shabatz-Loznica who violated their duty and who have permitted
the perpetrators of the crime to cross the frontier.</p>
<p>9. The Royal Government is ready to give explanations about the
expressions which its officials in Servia and abroad have made in
interviews after the outrage and which, according to the assertion
of the I. and R. Government, were hostile to the Monarchy. As soon
as the I. and R. Government points out in detail where those
expressions were made and succeeds in proving that those
expressions have actually been made by the functionaries concerned,
the Royal Government itself will take care that the necessary
evidences and proofs are collected therefor.</p>
<p><i>The Royal Servian Government must be aware of the interviews
in question. If it demands of the I. and R. Government that it
should furnish all kinds of detail about the said interviews and if
it reserves for itself the right of a formal investigation, it
shows that it is not its intention seriously to fulfill the
demand.</i></p>
<p>10. The Royal Government will notify the I. and R. Government,
so far as this has not been already done by the present note, of
the execution of the measures in question as soon as one of those
measures has been ordered and put into execution.</p>
<p>The Royal Servian Government believes it to be to the common
interest not to rush the solution of this affair and it is
therefore, in case the I. and R. Government should not consider
itself satisfied with this answer, ready, as ever, to accept a
peaceable solution, be it by referring the decision of this
question to the International Court at the Hague or by leaving it
to the decision of the Great Powers who have participated in the
working out of the declaration given by the Servian Government on
March 31st 1909.</p>
<p><i>The Servian Note, therefore, is entirely a play for
time.</i></p>
<center>EXHIBIT I.</center>
<p>The Chancellor to the Imperial Ambassadors at Paris, London, and
St. Petersburg, on Juli 23rd 1914.</p>
<p>The publications of the Austro-Hungarian Government concerning
the circumstances under which the Assassination of the Austrian
successor to the throne and his consort took place, disclose
clearly the aims which the pan-Serb propaganda has set itself and
the means which it utilizes for their realization. Through the
published facts the last doubt must disappear that the center of
action of the efforts for the separation of the south slavic
provinces from the Austro-Hungarian Monarchy and their union with
the Servian Kingdom must be sought in Belgrade where it displays
its activity with the connivance of members of the Government and
of the Army.</p>
<p>The Serb intrigues may be traced back through a series of years.
In a specially marked manner the pan-Serb chauvinism showed itself
during the Bosnian crisis. Only to the far-reaching self-restraint
and moderation of the Austro-Hungarian Government and the energetic
intercession of the powers is it to be ascribed that the
provocations to which at that time Austria-Hungary was exposed on
the part of Servia, did not lead to a conflict. The assurance of
future well-behaviour which the Servian Government gave at that
time, it has not kept. Under the very eyes, at least with the tacit
sufferance of official Servia, the pan-Serb propaganda has
meanwhile increased in scope and intensity; at its door is to be
laid the latest crime the threads of which lead to Belgrade. It has
become evident that it is compatible neither with the dignity nor
with the self-preservation of the Austro-Hungarian Monarchy to view
any longer idly the doings across the border through which the
safety and the integrity of the Monarchy are permanently
threatened. With this state of affairs, the action as well as the
demands of the Austro-Hungarian government can be viewed only as
justifiable. Nevertheless, the attitude assumed by public opinion
as well as by the government in Servia does not preclude the fear
that the Servian government will decline to meet these demands and
that it will allow itself to be carried away into a provocative
attitude toward Austria-Hungary. Nothing would remain for the
Austro-Hungarian government, unless it renounced definitely its
position as a great power, but to press its demands with the
Servian government and, if need be, enforce the same by appeal to
military measures, in regard to which the choice of means must be
left with it.</p>
<p>I have the honor to request you to express yourself in the sense
indicated above to (the present representative of M. Viviani) (Sir
Edward Grey) (M. Sasonow) and therewith give special emphasis to
the view that in this question there is concerned an affair which
should be settled solely between Austria-Hungary and Servia, the
limitation to which it must be the earnest endeavor of the powers
to insure. We anxiously desire the localisation of the conflict
because every intercession of another power on account of the
various treaty-alliances would precipitate inconceivable
consequences.</p>
<p>I shall look forward with interest to a telegraphic report about
the course of your interview.</p>
<center>EXHIBIT 2.</center>
<p>The Chancellor to the Governments of Germany. Confidential.
Berlin, July 28, 1914.</p>
<p>You will make the following report to the Government to which
you are accredited:</p>
<p>In view of the facts which the Austrian Government has published
in its note to the Servian Government, the last doubt must
disappear that the outrage to which the Austro-Hungarian successor
to the throne has fallen a victim, was prepared in Servia, to say
the least with the connivance of members of the Servian government
and army. It is a product of the pan-Serb intrigues which for a
series of years have become a source of permanent disturbance for
the Austro-Hungarian Monarchy and for the whole of Europe.</p>
<p>The pan-Serb chauvinism appeared especially marked during the
Bosnian crisis. Only to the far-reaching self-restraint and
moderation of the Austro-Hungarian government and the energetic
intercession of the powers is it to be ascribed that the
provocations to which Austria-Hungary was exposed at that time, did
not lead to a conflict. The assurance of future well-behaviour,
which the Servian government gave at that time, it has not kept.
Under the very eyes, at least with the tacit sufferance of official
Servia, the pan-Serb propaganda has meanwhile continued to increase
in scope and intensity. It would be compatible neither with its
dignity nor with its right to self-preservation if the
Austro-Hungarian government persisted to view idly any longer the
intrigues beyond the frontier, through which the safety and the
integrity of the monarchy are permanently threatened. With this
state of affairs, the action as well as the demands of the
Austro-Hungarian Government can be viewed only as justifiable.</p>
<p>The reply of the Servian government to the demands which the
Austro-Hungarian government put on the 23rd inst. through its
representative in Belgrade, shows that the dominating factors in
Servia are not inclined to cease their former policies and
agitation. There will remain nothing else for the Austro-Hungarian
government than to press its demands, if need be through military
action, unless it renounces for good its position as a great
power.</p>
<p>Some Russian personalities deem it their right as a matter of
course and a task of Russia's to actively become a party to Servia
in the conflict between Austria-Hungary and Servia. For the
European conflagration which would result from a similar step by
Russia, the "Nowoje Wremja" believes itself justified in making
Germany responsible in so far as it does not induce Austria-Hungary
to yield.</p>
<p>The Russian press thus turns conditions upside down. It is not
Austria-Hungary which has called forth the conflict with Servia,
but it is Servia which, through unscrupulous favor toward pan-Serb
aspirations, even in parts of the Austro-Hungarian monarchy,
threatens the same in her existence and creates conditions, which
eventually found expression in the wanton outrage at Sarajevo. If
Russia believes that it must champion the cause of Servia in this
matter, it certainly has the right to do so. However, it must
realize that it makes the Serb activities its own, to undermine the
conditions of existence of the Austro-Hungarian monarchy, and that
thus it bears the sole responsibility if out of the Austro-Servian
affair, which all other great powers desire to localize, there
arises a European war. This responsibility of Russia's is evident
and it weighs the more heavily as Count Berchtold has officially
declared to Russia that Austria-Hungary has no intention to acquire
Servian territory or to touch the existence of the Servian Kingdom,
but only desires peace against the Servian intrigues threatening
its existence.</p>
<p>The attitude of the Imperial government in this question is
clearly indicated. The agitation conducted by the pan-Slavs in
Austria-Hungary has for its goal, with the destruction of the
Austro-Hungarian monarchy, the scattering or weakening of the
triple alliance with a complete isolation of the German Empire in
consequence. Our own interest therefore calls us to the side of
Austria-Hungary. The duty, if at all possible, to guard Europe
against a universal war, points to the support by ourselves of
those endeavors which aim at the localization of the conflict,
faithful to the course of those policies which we have carried out
successfully for forty-four years in the interest of the
preservation of the peace of Europe.</p>
<p>Should, however, against our hope, through the interference of
Russia the fire be spread, we should have to support, faithful to
our duty as allies, the neighbor-monarchy with all the power at our
command. We shall take the sword only if forced to it, but then in
the clear consciousness that we are not guilty of the calamity
which war will bring upon the peoples of Europe.</p>
<center>EXHIBIT 3.</center>
<p>Telegram of the Imperial Ambassador at Vienna to the Chancellor
on July 24th 1914.</p>
<p>Count Berchtold has asked to-day for the Russian Charg&eacute;
d'affaires in order to explain to him thoroughly and cordially
Austria-Hungary's point of view toward Servia. After recapitulation
of the historical development of the past few years, he emphasized
that the Monarchy entertained no thought of conquest toward Servia.
Austria-Hungary would not claim Servian territory. It insisted
merely that this step was meant as a definite means of checking the
Serb intrigues. Impelled by force of circumstance, Austria-Hungary
must have a guaranty for continued amicable relations with Servia.
It was far from him to intend to bring about a change in the
balance of powers in the Balcan. The Charge d'affaires who had
received no instructions from St. Petersburg, took the discussion
of the Secretary "ad referendum" with the promise to submit it
immediately to Sasonow.</p>

<p>I have just utilized the contents of Order 592 in a prolonged
interview with Sasonow. The Secretary (Sasonow) indulged in
unmeasured accusations toward Austria-Hungary and he was very much
agitated. He declared most positively that Russia could not permit
under any circumstances that the Servo-Austrian difficulty be
settled alone between the parties concerned.</p>

as they told me afterwards. The assurance of the Ambassador that
Austria-Hungary had no idea of conquest but wished to obtain peace
at last at her frontiers, greatly pacified the Secretary.</p>

<p>Telegram of the Chancellor to the Imperial Ambassador at London.
Urgent. July 26th 1914.</p>
<p>Austria-Hungary has declared in St. Petersburg officially and
solemnly that it has no desire for territorial gain in Servia; that
it will not touch the existence of the Kingdom, but that it desires
to establish peaceful conditions. According to news received here,
the call for several classes of the reserves is expected
immediately which is equivalent to mobilization.[<a href=
"#note-186">186</a>] If this news proves correct, we shall be
forced to contermeasures very much against our own wishes. Our
desire to localize the conflict and to preserve the peace of Europe

<p>Telegram of the Imperial Chancellor to the Imperial Ambassador
at Paris. July 26th 1914.</p>
<p>After officially declaring to Russia that Austria-Hungary has no
intention to acquire territorial gain and to touch the existence of
the Kingdom, the decision whether there is to be a European war
rests solely with Russia which has to bear the entire
responsibility. We depend upon France with which we are at one in
the desire for the preservation of the peace of Europe that it will
exercise its influence at St. Petersburg in favour of peace.</p>

<p>Telegram of the Chancellor to the Imperial Ambassador at St.
Petersburg on July 26th, 1914.</p>
<p>After Austria's solemn declaration of its territorial
dis-interestedness, the responsibility for a possible disturbance
of the peace of Europe through a Russian intervention rests solely
upon Russia. We trust still that Russia will undertake no steps
which will threaten seriously the peace of Europe.</p>

Chancellor on July 27th, 1914.</p>
<p>Military Attach&eacute; reports a conversation with the
Secretary of War:</p>
<p>Sasonow has requested the latter to enlighten me on the
situation. The Secretary of War has given me his word of honor that
no order to mobilize has as yet been issued. Though general
preparations are being made, no reserves were called and no horses
mustered. If Austria crossed the Servian frontier, such military
districts as are directed toward Austria, viz., Kiev, Odessa,
Moscow, Kazan, are to be mobilized. Under no circumstances those on
the German frontier, Warsaw, Vilna, St. Petersburg. Peace with
Germany was desired very much. Upon my inquiry into the object of
mobilization against Austria he shrugged his shoulders and referred
to the diplomats. I told the Secretary that we appreciated the
friendly intentions, but considered mobilization even against
Austria as very menacing.</p>

<p>Telegram of the Chancellor to the Imperial Ambassador at London
on July 27th, 1914.</p>
<p>We know as yet nothing of a suggestion of Sir Edward Grey's to
hold a quadruple conference in London. It is impossible for us to
place our ally in his dispute with Servia before a European
tribunal. Our mediation must be limited to the danger of an
Austro-Russian conflict.</p>
<center>EXHIBIT 13.</center>
<p>Telegram of the Chancellor to the Imperial Ambassador at London
on July 25th, 1914.</p>
<p>The distinction made by Sir Edward Grey between an
Austro-Servian and an Austro-Russian conflict is perfectly correct.
We do not wish to interpose in the former any more than England,
and as heretofore we take the position that this question must be
localized by virtue of all powers refraining from intervention. It
is therefore our hope that Russia will refrain from any action in
view of her responsibility and the seriousness of the situation. We
are prepared, in the event of an Austro-Russian controversy, quite
apart from our known duties as allies, to intercede between Russia
and Austria jointly with the other powers.</p>

<p>Telegram of the Chancellor to the Imperial Ambassador at St.
Petersburg on July 28th, 1914.</p>
<p>We continue in our endeavor to induce Vienna to elucidate in St.
Petersburg the object and scope of the Austrian action in Servia in
a manner both convincing and satisfactory to Russia. The
declaration of war which has meanwhile ensued alters nothing in
this matter.</p>
<center>EXHIBIT 15.</center>
<p>Telegram of the Chancellor to the Imperial Ambassador in London
on July 27th, 1914.</p>

to Count Berchtold the desire of M. Sasonow for a direct parley
with Vienna.</p>

<p>Count Berchtold requests me to express to Your Excellency his

states, however, that after the opening of hostilities by Servia
and the subsequent declaration of war, the step appears
belated.</p>

<p>Telegram of the Chancellor to the Imperial Ambassador at Paris
on July 29th, 1914.</p>
<p>News received here regarding French preparations of war
multiplies from hour to hour. I request that You call the attention
of the French Government to this and accentuate that such measures
would call forth counter-measures on our part. We should have to
proclaim threatening state of war (drohende Kriegsgefahr), and
while this would not mean a call for the reserves or mobilization,
yet the tension would be aggravated. We continue to hope for the
preservation of peace.</p>

<p>Telegram of the Military Attache at St. Petersburg to H. M. the
Kaiser on July 30th, 1914.</p>
<p>Prince Troubetzki said to me yesterday, after causing Your
Majesty's telegram to be delivered at once to Czar Nicolas: Thank
God that a telegram of Your Emperor has come. He has just told me
the telegram has made a deep impression upon the Czar but as the
mobilization against Austria had already been ordered and Sasonow
had convinced His Majesty that it was no longer possible to
retreat, His Majesty was sorry he could not change it any more. I
then told him that the guilt for the measureless consequences lay
at the door of premature mobilization against Austria-Hungary which
after all was involved merely in a local war with Servia, for
Germany's answer was clear and the responsibility rested upon
Russia which ignored Austria-Hungary's assurance that it had no
intentions of territorial gain in Servia. Austria-Hungary mobilized
against Servia and not against Russia and there was no ground for
an immediate action on the part of Russia. I further added that in
Germany one could not understand any more Russia's phrase that "she
could not desert her brethren in Servia", after the horrible crime
of Sarajevo. I told him finally he need not wonder if Germany's
army were to be mobilized.</p>
<center>EXHIBIT 19.</center>
<p>Telegram of the Chancellor to the Imperial Ambassador at Rome on
July 31st, 1914.</p>
<p>We have continued to negotiate between Russia and
Austria-Hungary through a direct exchange of telegrams between His
Majesty the Kaiser and His Majesty the Czar, as well as in
conjunction with Sir Edward Grey. Through the mobilization of
Russia all our efforts have been greatly handicapped if they have
not become impossible. In spite of pacifying assurances Russia is
taking such far-reaching measures against us that the situation is
becoming continually more menacing.</p>
<center>EXHIBIT 20.</center>
<p>I. His Majesty to the Czar.</p>
<p>July 28th, 10.45 p.m.</p>
<p>I have heard with the greatest anxiety of the impression which
is caused by the action of Austria-Hungary against Servia. The
inscrupulous agitation which has been going on for years in Servia,
has led to the revolting crime of which Archduke Franz Ferdinand
has become a victim. The spirit which made the Servians murder
their own King and his consort, still dominates that country.
Doubtless You will agree with me that both of us, You as well as I,
and all other sovereigns, have a common interest to insist that all
those who are responsible for this horrible murder, shall suffer
their deserved punishment.</p>
<p>On the other hand I by no means overlook the difficulty
encountered by You and Your Government to stem the tide of public
opinion. In view of the cordial friendship which has joined us both
for a long time with firm ties, I shall use my entire influence to
induce Austria-Hungary to obtain a frank and satisfactory
understanding with Russia. I hope confidently that You will support
me in my efforts to overcome all difficulties which may yet
arise.</p>

<p>I am glad that You are back in Germany. In this serious moment I
ask You earnestly to help me. An ignominious war has been declared
against a weak country and in Russia the indignation which I fully
share is tremendous. I fear that very soon I shall be unable to
resist the pressure exercised upon me and that I shall be forced to
take measures which will lead to war. To prevent a calamity as a
European war would be, I urge You in the name of our old friendship
to do all in Your power to restrain Your ally from going too
far.</p>

<p>III. His Majesty to the Czar.</p>

<p>I have received Your telegram and I share Your desire for the
conservation of peace. However: I cannot&mdash;as I told You in my
first telegram&mdash;consider the action of Austria-Hungary as an
"ignominious war". Austria-Hungary knows from experience that the
promises of Servia as long as they are merely on paper are entirely
unreliable.</p>
<p>According to my opinion the action of Austria-Hungary is to be
considered as an attempt to receive full guaranty that the promises
of Servia are effectively translated into deeds. In this opinion I
am strengthened by the explanation of the Austrian cabinet that
Austria-Hungary intended no territorial gain at the expense of
Servia. I am therefore of opinion that it is perfectly possible for
Russia to remain a spectator in the Austro-Servian war without
drawing Europe into the most terrible war it has ever seen. I
believe that a direct understanding is possible and desirable
between Your Government and Vienna, an understanding which&mdash;as
I have already telegraphed You&mdash;my Government endeavors to aid
with all possible effort. Naturally military measures by Russia,
which might be construed as a menace by Austria-Hungary, would
accelerate a calamity which both of us desire to avoid and would
undermine my position as mediator which&mdash;upon Your appeal to
my friendship and aid&mdash;I willingly accepted.</p>

Government to the dangers and serious consequences of a
mobilization; I have told You the same in my last telegram.
Austria-Hungary has mobilized only against Servia, and only a part
of her army. If Russia, as seems to be the case according to Your
advice and that of Your Government, mobilizes against
Austria-Hungary, the part of the mediator with which You have
entrusted me in such friendly manner and which I have accepted upon
Your express desire, is threatened if not made impossible. The
entire weight of decision now rests upon Your shoulders, You have
to bear the responsibility for war or peace.</p>

to-night Tatisheft (Russian honorary aide to the Kaiser) with
instructions. The military measures now taking form were decided
upon five days ago, and for the reason of defence against the
preparations of Austria. I hope with all my heart that these
measures will not influence in any manner Your position as mediator
which I appraise very highly. We need Your strong pressure upon

THE EUROPEAN CRISIS</center>

<p>M. Sazionof telegraphs to the Russian Charg&eacute; d'Affaires
at Vienna on the 11th (24th) July, 1914:</p>
<p>"The communication made by Austria-Hungary to the Powers the day
after the presentation of the ultimatum at Belgrade leaves a period
to the Powers which is quite insufficient to enable them to take
any steps which might help to smooth away the difficulties that
have arisen.</p>
<p>"In order to prevent the consequences, equally incalculable and
fatal to all the Powers, which may result from the course of action
followed by the Austro-Hungarian Government, it seems to us to be
above all essential that the period allowed for the Servian reply
should be extended. Austria-Hungary, having declared her readiness
to inform the Powers of the results of the enquiry upon which the
Imperial and Royal Government base their accusations, should
equally allow them sufficient time to study them.</p>
<p>"In this case, if the Powers were convinced that certain of the
Austrian demands were well founded, they would be in a position to
offer advice to the Servian Government.</p>
<p>"A refusal to prolong the term of the ultimatum would render
nugatory the proposals made by the Austro-Hungarian Government to
the Powers, and would be in contradiction to the very bases of
international relations.</p>
<p>"Prince Kudachef is instructed to communicate the above to the
Cabinet at Vienna.</p>
<p>"M. Sazonof hopes that His Britannic Majesty's Government will
adhere to the point of view set forth above, and he trusts that Sir
E. Grey will see his way to furnish similar instructions to the
British Ambassador at Vienna."</p>

<p><i>Sir G. Buchanan to Sir Edward Grey.&mdash;(Received July</i>
25.)</p>
<p>(Telegraphic.) <i>St. Petersburgh, July</i> 25, 1914.</p>
<p>I Saw the Minister for Foreign Affairs this morning....</p>
<p>The Minister for Foreign Affairs said that Servia was quite
ready to do as you had suggested and to punish those proved to be
guilty, but that no independent State could be expected to accept
the political demands which had been put forward. The Minister for
Foreign Affairs thought, from a conversation which he had with the
Servian Minister yesterday, that, in the event of the Austrians
attacking Servia, the Servian Government would abandon Belgrade,
and withdraw their forces into the interior, while they would at
the same time appeal to the Powers to help them. His Excellency was
in favour of their making this appeal. He would like to see the
question placed on an international footing, as the obligations
taken by Servia in 1908, to which reference is made in the Austrian
ultimatum, were given not to Austria, but to the Powers.</p>
<p>If Servia should appeal to the Powers, Russia would be quite
ready to stand aside and leave the question in the hands of
England, France, Germany, and Italy. It was possible, in his
opinion, that Servia might propose to submit the question to
arbitration.</p>
<p>On my expressing the earnest hope that Russia would not
precipitate war by mobilising until you had had time to use your
influence in favour of peace, his Excellency assured me that Russia
had no aggressive intentions, and she would take no action until it
was forced on her. Austria's action was in reality directed against
Russia. She aimed at overthrowing the present <i>status quo</i> in
the Balkans, and establishing her own hegemony there. He did not
believe that Germany really wanted war, but her attitude was
decided by ours. If we took our stand firmly with France and Russia
there would be no war. If we failed them now, rivers of blood would
flow, and we would in the end be dragged into war. I said that
England could play the role of mediator at Berlin and Vienna to
better purpose as friend who, if her counsels of moderation were
disregarded, might one day be converted into an ally, than if she
were to declare herself Russia's ally at once. His Excellency said
that unfortunately Germany was convinced that she could count upon
our neutrality.</p>
<p>I said all I could to impress prudence on the Minister for
Foreign Affairs, and warned him that if Russia mobilised, Germany
would not be content with mere mobilisation, or give Russia time to
carry out hers, but would probably declare war at once. His
Excellency replied that Russia could not allow Austria to crush
Servia and become the predominant Power in the Balkans, and, if she
feels secure of the support of France, she will face all the risks
of war. He assured me once more that he did not wish to precipitate
a conflict, but that unless Germany could restrain Austria I could
regard the situation as desperate.</p>

<p><i>Sir H. Rumbold to Sir Edward Grey.&mdash;(Received July
25.)</i></p>
<p>(Telegraphic.) <i>Berlin, July 25, 1914.</i></p>
<p>Your telegram of the 24th July acted on.</p>
<p>Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs says that on receipt of a
telegram at 10 this morning from German Ambassador at London, he
immediately instructed German Ambassador at Vienna to pass on to
Austrian Minister for Foreign Affairs your suggestion for an
extension of time limit, and to speak to his Excellency about it.
Unfortunately it appeared from press that Count Berchtold is at
Ischl, and Secretary of State thought that in these circumstances
there would be delay and difficulty in getting time limit extended.
Secretary of State said that he did not know what Austria-Hungary
had ready on the spot, but he admitted quite freely that
Austro-Hungarian Government wished to give the Servians a lesson,
and that they meant to take military action. He also admitted that
Servian Government could not swallow certain of the
Austro-Hungarian demands.</p>
<p>Secretary of State said that a reassuring feature of situation
was that Count Berchtold had sent for Russian representative at
Vienna and had told him that Austria-Hungary had no intention of
seizing Servian territory. This step should, in his opinion,
exercise a calming influence at St. Petersburgh. I asked whether it
was not to be feared that, in taking military action against
Servia, Austria would dangerously excite public opinion in Russia.
He said he thought not. He remained of opinion that crisis could be
localised. I said that telegrams from Russia in this morning's
papers did not look very reassuring, but he maintained his
optimistic view with regard to Russia. He said that he had given
the Russian Government to understand that last thing Germany wanted
was a general war, and he would do all in his power to prevent such
a calamity. If the relations between Austria and Russia became
threatening, he was quite ready to fall in with your suggestion as
to the four Powers working in favour of moderation at Vienna and
St. Petersburgh.</p>
<p>Secretary of State confessed privately that he thought the note
left much to be desired as a diplomatic document. He repeated very
earnestly that, though he had been accused of knowing all about the
contents of that note, he had in fact had no such knowledge.</p>

<p><i>Sir M. de Bunsen to Sir Edward Grey.&mdash;(Received July
27.)</i></p>
<p>(Telegraphic.) <i>Vienna, July</i> 27, 1914.</p>
<p>I have had conversations with all my colleagues representing the
Great Powers. The impression left on my mind is that the
Austro-Hungarian note was so drawn up as to make war inevitable;
that the Austro-Hungarian Government are fully resolved to have war
with Servia; that they consider their position as a Great Power to
be at stake; and that until punishment has been administered to
Servia it is unlikely that they will listen to proposals of
mediation. This country has gone wild with joy at the prospect of
war with Servia, and its postponement or prevention would
undoubtedly be a great disappointment.</p>
<p>I propose, subject to any special directions you desire to send
me, to express to the Austrian Minister for Foreign Affairs the
hope of His Majesty's Government that it may yet be possible to
avoid war, and to ask his Excellency whether he cannot suggest a
way out even now.</p>
<p>No. 43.</p>
<p><i>Sir E. Goschen to Sir Edward Grey.&mdash;(Received July
27.)</i></p>
<p>(Telegraphic.) <i>Berlin, July</i> 27, 1914.</p>
<p>Your telegram of 26th July.</p>
<p>Secretary of State says that conference you suggest would
practically amount to a court of arbitration and could not, in his
opinion, be called together except at the request of Austria and
Russia. He could not therefore fall in with your suggestion,
desirous though he was to co-operate for the maintenance of peace.
I said I was sure that your idea had nothing to do with
arbitration, but meant that representatives of the four nations not
directly interested should discuss and suggest means for avoiding a
dangerous situation. He maintained, however, that such a conference
as you proposed was not practicable. He added that news he had just
received from St. Petersburgh showed that there was an intention on
the part of M. de Sazonof to exchange views with Count Berchtold.
He thought that this method of procedure might lead to a
satisfactory result, and that it would be best, before doing
anything else, to await outcome of the exchange of views between
the Austrian and Russian Governments.</p>
<p>In the course of a short conversation Secretary of State said
that as yet Austria was only partially mobilising, but that if
Russia mobilised against Germany latter would have to follow suit.
I asked him what he meant by "mobilising against Germany." He said
that if Russia only mobilised in south, Germany would not mobilise,
but if she mobilised in north, Germany would have to do so too, and
Russian system of mobilisation was so complicated that it might be
difficult exactly to locate her mobilisation. Germany would
therefore have to be very careful not to be taken by surprise.</p>
<p>Finally, Secretary of State said that news from St. Petersburgh
had caused him to take more hopeful view of the general
situation.</p>

<p><i>Sir M. de Bunsen to Sir Edward Grey.&mdash;(Received July
28.)</i></p>
<p>(Telegraphic.) <i>Vienna, July</i> 27, 1914.</p>
<p>The Russian Ambassador had to-day a long and earnest
conversation with Baron Macchio, the Under-secretary of State for
Foreign Affairs. He told him that, having just come back from St.
Petersburgh, he was well acquainted with the views of the Russian
Government and the state of Russian public opinion. He could assure
him that if actual war broke out with Servia it would be impossible
to localise it, for Russia was not prepared to give way again, as
she had done on previous occasions, and especially during the
annexation crisis of 1909. He earnestly hoped that something would
be done before Servia was actually invaded. Baron Macchio replied
that this would now be difficult, as a skirmish had already taken
place on the Danube, in which the Servians had been the aggressors.
The Russian Ambassador said that he would do all he could to keep
the Servians quiet pending any discussions that might yet take
place, and he told me that he would advise his Government to induce
the Servian Government to avoid any conflict as long as possible,
and to fall back before an Austrian advance. Time so gained should
suffice to enable a settlement to be reached. He had just heard of
a satisfactory conversation which the Russian Minister for Foreign
Affairs had yesterday with the Austrian Ambassador at St.
Petersburgh. The former had agreed that much of the
Austro-Hungarian note to Servia had been perfectly reasonable, and
in fact they had practically reached an understanding as to the
guarantees which Servia might reasonably be asked to give to
Austria-Hungary for her future good behaviour. The Russian
Ambassador urged that the Austrian Ambassador at St. Petersburgh
should be furnished with full powers to continue discussion with
the Russian Minister for Foreign Affairs, who was very willing to
advise Servia to yield all that could be fairly asked of her as an
independent Power. Baron Macchio promised to submit this suggestion
to the Minister for Foreign Affairs.</p>

<p><i>Sir M. de Bunsen to Sir Edward Grey.&mdash;(Received July

<p>(Telegraphic.) <i>Vienna, July 28</i>, 1914.</p>
<p>I spoke to Minister for Foreign Affairs to-day in the sense of
your telegram of 27th July to Berlin. I avoided the word
"mediation," but said that, as mentioned in your speech,[<a href=
"#note-187">187</a>] which he had just read to me, you had hopes
that conversations in London between the four Powers less
interested might yet lead to an arrangement which Austro-Hungarian
Government would accept as satisfactory and as rendering actual
hostilities unnecessary. I added that you had regarded Servian
reply as having gone far to meet just demands of Austria-Hungary;
that you thought it constituted a fair basis of discussion during
which warlike operations might remain in abeyance, and that
Austrian Ambassador in Berlin was speaking in this sense. Minister
for Foreign Affairs said quietly, but firmly, that no discussion
could be accepted on basis of Servian note; that war would be
declared to-day, and that well-known pacific character of Emperor,
as well as, he might add, his own, might be accepted as a guarantee
that war was both just and inevitable. This was a matter that must
be settled directly between the two parties immediately concerned.
I said that you would hear with regret that hostilities could not
now be arrested, as you feared that they might lead to
complications threatening the peace of Europe.</p>
<p>In taking leave of his Excellency, I begged him to believe that,
if in the course of present grave crisis our point of view should
sometimes differ from his, this would arise, not from want of
sympathy with the many just complaints which Austria-Hungary had
against Servia, but from the fact that, whereas Austria-Hungary put
first her quarrel with Servia, you were anxious in the first
instance for peace of Europe. I trusted this larger aspect of the
question would appeal with equal force to his Excellency. He said
he had it also in mind, but thought that Russia ought not to oppose
operations like those impending, which did not aim at territorial
aggrandisement and which could no longer be postponed.</p>

<p>(Telegraphic.) <i>Berlin, July</i> 29, 1914.</p>
<p>I was asked to call upon the Chancellor to-night. His Excellency
had just returned from Potsdam.</p>
<p>He said that should Austria be attacked by Russia a European
conflagration might, he feared, become inevitable, owing to
Germany's obligations as Austria's ally, in spite of his continued
efforts to maintain peace. He then proceeded to make the following
strong bid for British neutrality. He said that it was clear, so
far as he was able to judge the main principle which governed
British policy, that Great Britain would never stand by and allow
France to be crushed in any conflict there might be. That, however,
was not the object at which Germany aimed. Provided that neutrality
of Great Britain were certain, every assurance would be given to
the British Government that the Imperial Government aimed at no
territorial acquisitions at the expense of France should they prove
victorious in any war that might ensue.</p>
<p>I questioned his Excellency about the French colonies, and he
said that he was unable to give a similar undertaking in that
respect. As regards Holland, however, his Excellency said that, so
long as Germany's adversaries respected the integrity and
neutrality of the Netherlands, Germany was ready to give His
Majesty's Government an assurance that she would do likewise. It
depended upon the action of France what operations Germany might be
forced to enter upon in Belgium, but when the war was over, Belgian
integrity would be respected if she had not sided against
Germany.</p>
<p>His Excellency ended by saying that ever since he had been
Chancellor the object of his policy had been, as you were aware, to
bring about an understanding with England; he trusted that these
assurances might form the basis of that understanding which he so
much desired. He had in mind a general neutrality agreement between
England and Germany, though it was of course at the present moment
too early to discuss details, and an assurance of British
neutrality in the conflict which present crisis might possibly
produce, would enable him to look forward to realisation of his
desire.</p>
<p>In reply to his Excellency's enquiry how I thought his request
would appeal to you, I said that I did not think it probable that
at this stage of events you would care to bind yourself to any
course of action and that I was of opinion that you would desire to
retain full liberty.</p>
<p>Our conversation upon this subject having come to an end, I
communicated the contents of your telegram of to-day to his
Excellency, who expressed his best thanks to you.</p>

<p>Sir, <i>Foreign Office, July</i> 29, 1914.</p>
<p>After telling M. Cambon to-day how grave the situation seemed to
be, I told him that I meant to tell the German Ambassador to-day
that he must not be misled by the friendly tone of our
conversations into any sense of false security that we should stand
aside if all the efforts to preserve the peace, which we were now
making in common with Germany, failed. But I went on to say to M.
Cambon that I thought it necessary to tell him also that public
opinion here approached the present difficulty from a quite
different point of view from that taken during the difficulty as to
Morocco a few years ago. In the case of Morocco the dispute was one
in which France was primarily interested, and in which it appeared
that Germany, in an attempt to crush France, was fastening a
quarrel on France on a question that was the subject of a special
agreement between France and us. In the present case the dispute
between Austria and Servia was not one in which we felt called to
take a hand. Even if the question became one between Austria and
Russia we should not feel called upon to take a hand in it. It
would then be a question of the supremacy of Teuton or Slav&mdash;a
struggle for supremacy in the Balkans; and our idea had always been
to avoid being drawn into a war over a Balkan question. If Germany
became involved and France became involved, we had not made up our
minds what we should do; it was a case that we should have to
consider. France would then have been drawn into a quarrel which
was not hers, but in which, owing to her alliance, her honour and
interest obliged her to engage. We were free from engagements, and
we should have to decide what British interests required us to do.
I thought it necessary to say that, because, as he knew, we were
taking all precautions with regard to our fleet, and I was about to
warn Prince Lichnowsky not to count on our standing aside, but it
would not be fair that I should let M. Cambon be misled into
supposing that this meant that we had decided what to do in a
contingency that I still hoped might not arise.</p>
<p>M. Cambon said that I had explained the situation very clearly.
He understood it to be that in a Balkan quarrel, and in a struggle
for supremacy between Teuton and Slav we should not feel called to
intervene; should other issues be raised, and Germany and France
become involved, so that the question became one of the hegemony of
Europe, we should then decide what it was necessary for us to do.
He seemed quite prepared for this announcement, and made no
criticism upon it.</p>
<p>He said French opinion was calm, but decided. He anticipated a
demand from Germany that France would be neutral while Germany
attacked Russia. This assurance France, of course, could not give;
she was bound to help Russia if Russia was attacked.</p>

<p><i>Sir Edward Grey to Sir E. Goschen</i>.</p>
<p>Sir, <i>Foreign Office, July</i> 29, 1914.</p>
<p>After speaking to the German Ambassador this afternoon about the
European situation, I said that I wished to say to him, in a quite
private and friendly way, something that was on my mind. The
situation was very grave. While it was restricted to the issues at
present actually involved we had no thought of interfering in it.
But if Germany became involved in it, and then France, the issue
might be so great that it would involve all European interests; and
I did not wish him to be misled by the friendly tone of our
conversation&mdash;which I hoped would continue&mdash;into thinking
that we should stand aside.</p>
<p>He said that he quite understood this, but he asked whether I
meant that we should, under certain circumstances, intervene?</p>
<p>I replied that I did not wish to say that, or to use anything
that was like a threat or an attempt to apply pressure by saying
that, if things became worse, we should intervene. There would be
no question of our intervening if Germany was not involved, or even
if France was not involved. But we knew very well that, if the
issue did become such that we thought British interests required us
to intervene, we must intervene at once, and the decision would
have to be very rapid, just as the decisions of other Powers had to
be. I hoped that the friendly tone of our conversations would
continue as at present, and that I should be able to keep as
closely in touch with the German Government in working for peace.
But if we failed in our efforts to keep the peace, and if the issue
spread so that it involved practically every European interest, I
did not wish to be open to any reproach from him that the friendly
tone of all our conversations had misled him or his Government into
supposing that we should not take action, and to the reproach that,
if they had not been so misled, the course of things might have
been different.</p>
<p>The German Ambassador took no exception to what I had said;
indeed, he told me that it accorded with what he had already given
in Berlin as his view of the situation.</p>

<p>(Telegraphic.) <i>Berlin, July</i> 30, 1914.</p>
<p>Secretary of State informs me that immediately on receipt of
Prince Lichnowsky's telegram recording his last conversation with
you he asked Austro-Hungarian Government whether they would be
willing to accept mediation on basis of occupation by Austrian
troops of Belgrade or some other point and issue their conditions
from there. He has up till now received no reply, but he fears
Russian mobilisation against Austria will have increased
difficulties, as Austria-Hungary, who has as yet only mobilised
against Servia, will probably find it necessary also against
Russia. Secretary of State says if you can succeed in getting
Russia to agree to above basis for an arrangement and in persuading
her in the meantime to take no steps which might be regarded as an
act of aggression against Austria he still sees some chance that
European peace may be preserved.</p>
<p>He begged me to impress on you difficulty of Germany's position
in view of Russian mobilisation and military measures which he
hears are being taken in France. Beyond recall of officers on
leave&mdash;a measure which had been officially taken after, and
not before, visit of French Ambassador yesterday&mdash;Imperial
Government had done nothing special in way of military
preparations. Something, however, would have soon to be done, for
it might be too late, and when they mobilised they would have to
mobilise on three sides. He regretted this, as he knew France did
not desire war, but it would be a military necessity.</p>
<p>His Excellency added that telegram received from Prince
Lichnowsky last night contains matter which he had heard with
regret, but not exactly with surprise, and at all events he
thoroughly appreciated frankness and loyalty with which you had
spoken.</p>
<p>He also told me that this telegram had only reached Berlin very
late last night; had it been received earlier Chancellor would, of
course, not have spoken to me in way he had done.</p>

<p>Your telegram of 29th July.[<a href="#note-188">188</a>]</p>
<p>His Majesty's Government cannot for a moment entertain the
Chancellor's proposal that they should bind themselves to
neutrality on such terms.</p>
<p>What he asks us in effect is to engage to stand by while French
colonies are taken and France is beaten so long as Germany does not
take French territory as distinct from the colonies.</p>
<p>From the material point of view such a proposal is unacceptable,
for France, without further territory in Europe being taken from
her, could be so crushed as to lose her position as a Great Power,
and become subordinate to German policy.</p>
<p>Altogether, apart from that, it would be a disgrace for us to
make this bargain with Germany at the expense of France, a disgrace
from which the good name of this country would never recover.</p>
<p>The Chancellor also in effect asks us to bargain away whatever
obligation or interest we have as regards the neutrality of
Belgium. We could not entertain that bargain either.</p>
<p>Having said so much, it is unnecessary to examine whether the
prospect of a future general neutrality agreement between England
and Germany offered positive advantages sufficient to compensate us
for tying our hands now. We must preserve our full freedom to act
as circumstances may seem to us to require in any such unfavourable
and regrettable development of the present crisis as the Chancellor
contemplates.</p>
<p>You should speak to the Chancellor in the above sense, and add
most earnestly that the one way of maintaining the good relations
between England and Germany is that they should continue to work
together to preserve the peace of Europe; if we succeed in this
object, the mutual relations of Germany and England will, I
believe, be <i>ipso facto</i> improved and strengthened. For that
object His Majesty's Government will work in that way with all
sincerity and good-will.</p>
<p>And I will say this: If the peace of Europe can be preserved,
and the present crisis safely passed, my own endeavour will be to
promote some arrangement to which Germany could be a party, by
which she could be assured that no aggressive or hostile policy
would be pursued against her or her allies by France, Russia, and
ourselves, jointly or separately. I have desired this and worked
for it, as far as I could, through the last Balkan crisis, and,
Germany having a corresponding object, our relations sensibly
improved. The idea has hitherto been too Utopian to form the
subject of definite proposals, but if this present crisis, so much
more acute than any that Europe has gone through for generations,
be safely passed, I am hopeful that the relief and reaction which
will follow may make possible some more definite rapprochement
between the Powers than has been possible hitherto.</p>

<p>Enclosure 1 in No. 105.</p>
<p><i>Sir Edward Grey to M. Cambon</i>.</p>
<p>My dear Ambassador, <i>Foreign Office, November 22</i>,
1912.</p>
<p>From time to time in recent years the French and British naval
and military experts have consulted together. It has always been
understood that such consultation does not restrict the freedom of
either Government to decide at any future time whether or not to
assist the other by armed force. We have agreed that consultation
between experts is not, and ought not to be regarded as, an
engagement that commits either Government to action in a
contingency that has not arisen and may never arise. The
disposition, for instance, of the French and British fleets
respectively at the present moment is not based upon an engagement
to co-operate in war.</p>
<p>You have, however, pointed out that, if either Government had
grave reason to expect an unprovoked attack by a third Power, it
might become essential to know whether it could in that event
depend upon the armed assistance of the other.</p>
<p>I agree that, if either Government had grave reason to expect an
unprovoked attack by a third Power, or something that threatened
the general peace, it should immediately discuss with the other
whether both Governments should act together to prevent aggression
and to preserve peace, and, if so, what measures they would be
prepared to take in common. If these measures involved action, the
plans of the General Staffs would at once be taken into
consideration, and the Governments would then decide what effect
should be given to them.</p>
<p>Yours, &amp;c.</p>

<p>No. 119.</p>
<p><i>Sir Edward Grey to Sir F. Bertie</i>.</p>
<p>Sir, <i>Foreign Office, July</i> 31, 1914.</p>
<p>M. Cambon referred to-day to a telegram that had been shown to
Sir Arthur Nicolson this morning from the French Ambassador in
Berlin, saying that it was the uncertainty with regard to whether
we would intervene which was the encouraging element in Berlin, and
that, it we would only declare definitely on the side of Russia and
France, it would decide the German attitude in favour of peace.</p>
<p>I said that it was quite wrong to suppose that we had left
Germany under the impression that we would not intervene. I had
refused overtures to promise that we should remain neutral. I had
not only definitely declined to say that we would remain neutral, I
had even gone so far this morning as to say to the German
Ambassador that, if France and Germany became involved in war, we
should be drawn into it. That, of course, was not the same thing as
taking an engagement to France, and I told M. Cambon of it only to
show that we had not left Germany under the impression that we
would stand aside.</p>
<p>M. Cambon then asked me for my reply to what he had said
yesterday.</p>
<p>I said that we had come to the conclusion, in the Cabinet
to-day, that we could not give any pledge at the present time.
Though we should have to put our policy before Parliament, we could
not pledge Parliament in advance. Up to the present moment, we did
not feel, and public opinion did not feel, that any treaties or
obligations of this country were involved. Further developments
might alter this situation and cause the Government and Parliament
to take the view that intervention was justified. The preservation
of the neutrality of Belgium might be, I would not say a decisive,
but an important factor, in determining our attitude. Whether we
proposed to Parliament to intervene or not to intervene in a war,
Parliament would wish to know how we stood with regard to the
neutrality of Belgium, and it might be that I should ask both
France and Germany whether each was prepared to undertake an
engagement that she would not be the first to violate the
neutrality of Belgium.</p>
<p>M. Cambon repeated his question whether we would help France if
Germany made an attack on her.</p>
<p>I said that I could only adhere to the answer that, as far as
things had gone at present, we could not take any engagement.</p>
<p>M. Cambon urged that Germany had from the beginning rejected
proposals that might have made for peace. It could not be to
England's interest that France should be crushed by Germany. We
should then be in a very diminished position with regard to
Germany. In 1870 we had made a great mistake in allowing an
enormous increase of German strength, and we should now be
repeating the mistake. He asked me whether I could not submit his
question to the Cabinet again.</p>
<p>I said that the Cabinet would certainly be summoned as soon as
there was some new development, but at the present moment the only
answer I could give was that we could not undertake any definite
engagement.</p>

<p>Neutrality of Belgium, referred to in your telegram of 31st July
to Sir F. Bertie.</p>
<p>I have seen Secretary of State, who informs me that he must
consult the Emperor and the Chancellor before he could possibly
answer. I gathered from what he said that he thought any reply they
might give could not but disclose a certain amount of their plan of
campaign in the event of war ensuing, and he was therefore very
doubtful whether they would return any answer at all. His
Excellency, nevertheless, took note of your request.</p>
<p>It appears from what he said that German Government consider
that certain hostile acts have already been committed by Belgium.
As an instance of this, he alleged that a consignment of corn for
Germany had been placed under an embargo already.</p>
<p>I hope to see his Excellency to-morrow again to discuss the
matter further, but the prospect of obtaining a definite answer
seems to me remote.</p>
<p>In speaking to me to-day the Chancellor made it clear that
Germany would in any case desire to know the reply returned to you
by the French Government.</p>
<p>No. 123.</p>
<p><i>Sir Edward Grey to Sir E. Goschen</i>.</p>
<p>Sir, <i>Foreign Office, August</i> 1, 1914.</p>
<p>I told the German Ambassador to-day that the reply[<a href=
"#note-189">189</a>] of the German Government with regard to the
neutrality of Belgium was a matter of very great regret, because
the neutrality of Belgium affected feeling in this country. If
Germany could see her way to give the same assurance as that which
had been given by France it would materially contribute to relieve
anxiety and tension here. On the other hand, if there were a
violation of the neutrality of Belgium by one combatant while the
other respected it, it would be extremely difficult to restrain
public feeling in this country. I said that we had been discussing
this question at a Cabinet meeting, and as I was authorised to tell
him this I gave him a memorandum of it.</p>
<p>He asked me whether, if Germany gave a promise not to violate
Belgian neutrality, we would engage to remain neutral.</p>
<p>I replied that I could not say that; our hands were still free,
and we were considering what our attitude should be. All I could
say was that our attitude would be determined largely by public
opinion here, and that the neutrality of Belgium would appeal very
strongly to Public opinion here. I did not think that we could give
a promise of neutrality on that condition alone.</p>
<p>The Ambassador pressed me as to whether I could not formulate
conditions on which we would remain neutral. He even suggested that
the integrity of France and her colonies might be guaranteed.</p>
<p>I said that I felt obliged to refuse definitely any promise to
remain neutral on similar terms, and I could only say that we must
keep our hands free.</p>

only after a decree of general mobilisation had been issued in

that, although the measures which the German Government have
already taken are in effect a general mobilisation, they are not so
designated; that a French general mobilisation will become
necessary in self-defence, and that France is already forty-eight
hours behind Germany as regards German military preparations; that
the French troops have orders not to go nearer to the German
frontier than a distance of 10 kilom. so as to avoid any grounds
for accusations of provocation to Germany, whereas the German

have made incursions on it; that, notwithstanding mobilisations,
the Emperor of Russia has expressed himself ready to continue his

<p>After the Cabinet this morning I gave M. Cambon the following
memorandum:&mdash;</p>
<p>"I am authorised to give an assurance that, if the German fleet
comes into the Channel or through the North Sea to undertake
hostile operations against French coasts or shipping, the British
fleet will give all the protection in its power.</p>
<p>"This assurance is of course subject to the policy of His
Majesty's Government receiving the support of Parliament, and must
not be taken as binding His Majesty's Government to take any action
until the above contingency of action by the German fleet takes
place."</p>
<p>I pointed out that we had very large questions and most
difficult issues to consider, and that Government felt that they
could not bind themselves to declare war upon Germany necessarily
if war broke out between France and Germany to-morrow, but it was
essential to the French Government, whose fleet had long been
concentrated in the Mediterranean, to know how to make their
dispositions with their north coast entirely undefended. We
therefore thought it necessary to give them this assurance. It did
not bind us to go to war with Germany unless the German fleet took
the action indicated, but it did give a security to France that
would enable her to settle the disposition of her own Mediterranean
fleet.</p>
<p>M. Cambon asked me about the violation of Luxemburg. I told him
the doctrine on that point laid down by Lord Derby and Lord
Clarendon in 1867. He asked me what we should say about the
violation of the neutrality of Belgium. I said that was a much more
important matter; we were considering what statement we should make
in Parliament to-morrow&mdash;in effect, whether we should declare
violation of Belgian neutrality to be a <i>casus belli</i>. I told
him what had been said to the German Ambassador on this point.</p>

King for diplomatic intervention on behalf of Belgium in the
following terms:&mdash;</p>
<p>"Remembering the numerous proofs of your Majesty's friendship
and that of your predecessor, and the friendly attitude of England
in 1870 and the proof of friendship you have just given us again, I
make a supreme appeal to the diplomatic intervention of your
Majesty's Government to safeguard the integrity of Belgium."</p>
<p>His Majesty's Government are also informed that the German
Government has delivered to the Belgian Government a note proposing
friendly neutrality entailing free passage through Belgian
territory, and promising to maintain the independence and integrity
of the kingdom and its possessions at the conclusion of peace,
threatening in case of refusal to treat Belgium as an enemy. An
answer was requested within twelve hours.</p>
<p>We also understand that Belgium has categorically refused this
as a flagrant violation of the law of nations.</p>
<p>His Majesty's Government are bound to protest against this
violation of a treaty to which Germany is a party in common with
themselves, and must request an assurance that the demand made upon
Belgium will not be proceeded with and that her neutrality will be
respected by Germany. You should ask for an immediate reply.</p>

<h2>APPENDIX III</h2>
<p>Extract from the Dispatch from His Majesty's Ambassador at
Berlin respecting the Rupture of Diplomatic Relations with the
German Government.</p>
<p>(Cd. 7445.)</p>
<p><i>Sir E. Goschen to Sir Edward Grey</i>.</p>
<p>Sir, <i>London, August</i> 8, 1914.</p>
<p>In accordance with the instructions contained in your telegram
of the 4th instant I called upon the Secretary of State that
afternoon and enquired, in the name of His Majesty's Government,
whether the Imperial Government would refrain from violating
Belgian neutrality. Herr von Jagow at once replied that he was
sorry to say that his answer must be "No," as, in consequence of
the German troops having crossed the frontier that morning, Belgian
neutrality had been already violated. Herr von Jagow again went
into the reasons why the Imperial Government had been obliged to
take this step, namely, that they had to advance into France by the
quickest and easiest way, so as to be able to get well ahead with
their operations and endeavour to strike some decisive blow as
early as possible. It was a matter of life and death for them, as
if they had gone by the more southern route they could not have
hoped, in view of the paucity of roads and the strength of the
fortresses, to have got through without formidable opposition
entailing great loss of time. This loss of time would have meant
time gained by the Russians for bringing up their troops to the
German frontier. Rapidity of action was the great German asset,
while that of Russia was an inexhaustible supply of troops. I
pointed out to Herr von Jagow that this <i>fait accompli</i> of the
violation of the Belgian frontier rendered, as he would readily
understand, the situation exceedingly grave, and I asked him
whether there was not still time to draw back and avoid possible
consequences, which both he and I would deplore. He replied that,
for the reasons he had given me, it was now impossible for them to
draw back.</p>
<p>During the afternoon I received your further telegram of the
same date, and, in compliance with the instructions therein
contained, I again proceeded to the Imperial Foreign Office and
informed the Secretary of State that unless the Imperial Government
could give the assurance by 12 o'clock that night that they would
proceed no further with their violation of the Belgian frontier and
stop their advance, I had been instructed to demand my passports
and inform the Imperial Government that His Majesty's Government
would have to take all steps in their power to uphold the
neutrality of Belgium and the observance of a treaty to which
Germany was as much a party as themselves.</p>
<p>Herr von Jagow replied that to his great regret he could give no
other answer than that which he had given me earlier in the day,
namely, that the safety of the Empire rendered it absolutely
necessary that the Imperial troops should advance through Belgium.
I gave his Excellency a written summary of your telegram and,
pointing out that you had mentioned 12 o'clock as the time when His
Majesty's Government would expect an answer, asked him whether, in
view of the terrible consequences which would necessarily ensue, it
were not possible even at the last moment that their answer should
be reconsidered. He replied that if the time given were even
twenty-four hours or more, his answer must be the same. I said that
in that case I should have to demand my passports. This interview
took place at about 7 o'clock. In a short conversation which ensued
Herr von Jagow expressed his poignant regret at the crumbling of
his entire policy and that of the Chancellor, which had been to
make friends with Great Britain and then, through Great Britain, to
get closer to France. I said that this sudden end to my work in
Berlin was to me also a matter of deep regret and disappointment,
but that he must understand that under the circumstances and in
view of our engagements, His Majesty's Government could not
possibly have acted otherwise than they had done.</p>
<p>I then said that I should like to go and see the Chancellor, as
it might be, perhaps, the last time I should have an opportunity of
seeing him. He begged me to do so. I found the Chancellor very
agitated. His Excellency at once began a harangue, which lasted for
about 20 minutes. He said that the step taken by His Majesty's
Government was terrible to a degree; just for a
word&mdash;"neutrality," a word which in war time had so often been
disregarded&mdash;just for a scrap of paper Great Britain was going
to make war on a kindred nation who desired nothing better than to
be friends with her. All his efforts in that direction had been
rendered useless by this last terrible step, and the policy to
which, as I knew, he had devoted himself since his accession to
office had tumbled down like a house of cards. What we had done was
unthinkable; it was like striking a man from behind while he was
fighting for his life against two assailants. He held Great Britain
responsible for all the terrible events that might happen. I
protested strongly against that statement, and said that, in the
same way as he and Herr von Jagow wished me to understand that for
strategical reasons it was a matter of life and death to Germany to
advance through Belgium and violate the latter's neutrality, so I
would wish him to understand that it was, so to speak, a matter of
"life and death" for the honour of Great Britain that she should
keep her solemn engagement to do her utmost to defend Belgium's
neutrality if attacked. That solemn compact simply had to be kept,
or what confidence could anyone have in engagements given by Great
Britain in the future? The Chancellor said, "But at what price will
that compact have been kept. Has the British Government thought of
that?" I hinted to his Excellency as plainly as I could that fear
of consequences could hardly be regarded as an excuse for breaking
solemn engagements, but his Excellency was so excited, so evidently
overcome by the news of our action, and so little disposed to hear
reason that I refrained from adding fuel to the flame by further
argument. As I was leaving he said that the blow of Great Britain
joining Germany's enemies was all the greater that almost up to the
last moment he and his Government had been working with us and
supporting our efforts to maintain peace between Austria and
Russia. I said that this was part of the tragedy which saw the two
nations fall apart just at the moment when the relations between
them had been more friendly and cordial than they had been for
years. Unfortunately, notwithstanding our efforts to maintain peace
between Russia and Austria, the war had spread and had brought us
face to face with a situation which, if we held to our engagements,
we could not possibly avoid, and which unfortunately entailed our
separation from our late fellow-workers. He would readily
understand that no one regretted this more than I.</p>
<p>After this somewhat painful interview I returned to the embassy
and drew up a telegraphic report of what had passed. This telegram
was handed in at the Central Telegraph Office a little before 9
P.M. It was accepted by that office, but apparently never
despatched.[<a href="#note-190">190</a>]</p>

<center>THE CRIME OF SERAJEVO<br />
SELECTIONS FROM THE AUSTRIAN <i>dossier</i> OF THE CRIME</center>
<p>The following document is contained in the German Version of the
German White Book (pp. 28-31); and though it adds little to our
knowledge of the Austrian case against Servia, it deserves to be
reprinted, as it is omitted altogether in the official version in
English of the German White Book. The authorship of the document is
uncertain. It has the appearance of an extract from a German
newspaper.</p>
<p>Aus dem &ouml;sterreich-ungarischen Material.</p>
<p>Wien, 27. Juli. Das in der &ouml;sterreichisch-ungarischen
Zirkularnote an die ausw&auml;rtigen Botschaften in Angelegenheit
des serbischen Konflikts erw&auml;hnte Dossier wird heute
ver&ouml;ffentlicht.</p>
<p>In diesem Memoire wird darauf hingewiesen, dass die von Serbien
ausgegangene Bewegung, die sich zum Ziele gesetzt hat, die
s&uuml;dlichen Teile Oesterreich-Ungarns von der Monarchie
loszureiszen, um sie mit Serbien zu einer staatlichen Einheit zu
verbinden, weit zur&uuml;ckgreist. Diese in ihren Endzielen stets
gleichbleibende und nur in ihren Mitteln und an Intensit&auml;t
wechselnde Propaganda erreichte zur Zeit der Unnerionskrise ihren
H&ouml;hepunft und trat damals ossen mit ihren Tendenzen hervor.
W&auml;hrend einerjeits die gesamte serbische Bresse zum Kampfe
gegen die Monarchie ausrief, bildeten sich&mdash;von anderen
Propagandamitteln abgesehen&mdash;Ussoziationen, die diese
K&auml;mpfe vorbereiteten, unter denen die Harodna Odbrana an
Bedeutung hervorragte. Aus einem revolution&auml;ren Komitee
hervorgegangen, fonstituierte sich diese vom Belgrader
Ausw&auml;rtigen Amte v&ouml;llig abh&auml;ngige Organisation unter
Leitung von Staatsm&auml;nnern und Offizieren, darunter dem General
Tantovic und dem ehemaligen Minister Ivanovic. Auch Major Oja
Jantovic und Milan Pribicevic geh&ouml;ren zu diesen Gr&uuml;ndern.
Dieser Berein hatte sich die Bildung und Ausr&uuml;stung von
Freischaren f&uuml;r den bevorstehenden Krieg gegen die
&ouml;fterreichisch-ungarische Monarchie zum Ziele gesetzt. In
einer dem Memoire angef&uuml;gten Anlage wird ein Auszug aus dem
vom Zentralausschusse der Narodna Odbrana herausgegebenen
Vereinsorgane gleichen Namens ver&ouml;ffentlicht, worin in
mehreren Artikeln die T&auml;tigfelt und Ziele dieses Vereins
ausf&uuml;hrlich dargelegt werden. Es hei&szlig;t darin, da&szlig;
zu der Hauptaufgabe der Narodna Odbrana die Verbindung mit ihren
nahen und ferneren Br&uuml;dern jenseits der Grenze und unseren
&uuml;brigen Freunden in der Welt geh&ouml;ren.</p>
<p><i>Oesterreich ist als erster und gr&ouml;&szlig;ter Feind
bezeichnet</i>. Wie die Narodna Odbrana die Notwendigkeit des
Kampfes mit Oesterreich predigt, predigt sie eine heilige Wahrheit
unserer nationalen Lage. Das Schlu&szlig;kapitel enth&auml;lt einen
Apell an die Regierung und das Volk Serbiens, sich mit allen
Mitteln f&uuml;r den Kampf vorzubereiten, den die Annexion
vorangezeigt hat.</p>
<p>Das Memoire schildert nach einer Aussage eines von der Narodna
Odbrana angeworbenen Komitatschis die damalige T&auml;tigkeit der
Narodna Odbrana, die eine von zwei Hauptleuten, darunter Jankovic,
geleitete <i>Schule zur Ausbildung von Banden</i> unterhielt,
Schulen, welche von General Jankovic und von Hauptmann Milan
Pribicevic regelm&auml;&szlig;ig inspiziert wurden. Weiter wurden
die Komitatschis im <i>Schie&szlig;en und Bombenwerfen, im
Minenlegen, Sprengen von Eisenbahnbr&uuml;cken</i> usw.
unterrichtet. Nach der feierlichen Erkl&auml;rung der Serbischen
Regierung vom Jahre 1909 schien auch das Ende dieser Organisation
gekommen zu sein. Diese Erwartungen haben sich aber nicht nur nicht
erf&uuml;llt, sondern die Propaganda wurde durch die serbische
Presse fortgesetzt. Das Memoire f&uuml;hrt als Beispiel die Art und
Weise an, wie das Attentat gegen den bosnischen Landeschef
Varesanin publizistisch verwertet wurde, indem der Attent&auml;ter
als serbischer Nationalheld gefeiert und seine Tat verherrlicht
wurde. Diese Bl&auml;tter wurden nicht nur in Serbien verbreitet,
sondern auch auf wohlorganisierten Schleichwegen in die Monarchie
hineingeschmuggelt.</p>
<p>Unter der gleichen Leitung wie bei ihrer Gr&uuml;ndung wurde die
Narodna Odbrana neuerlich der zentralpunkt einer Agitation welcher
der <i>Sch&uuml;tzenbund mit 762 Vereinen, ein Sokolbund mit 3500
Mitgliedern, und verschiedene andere Vereine
angeh&ouml;rten</i>.</p>
<p>Im Kleide eines Kulturvereins auftretend, dem nur die geistige
und die f&uuml;&ouml;rperliche Entwickelung der Bev&ouml;lkerung
Serbiens sowie deren materielle Kr&auml;ftigung am Herzen liegt,
enthullt die Narodna Oobrana ihr wahres reorganisiertes Programm in
vorzitiertem Auszug aus ihrem Vereinsorgan, in welchem "die heilige
Wahrheit" gepredigt wird, dass es eine unerl&auml;ssliche
Notwendigkeit ist, gegen Oesterreich, seinen ersten gr&ouml;ssten
Feind, diesen Ausrottungskampf mit Gewehr und Kanone zu
f&uuml;hren, und das Volk mit allen Mitteln auf den Kampf
vorzubereiten, zur Befreiung der unterworfenen Gebiete, in denen
viele Millionen unterjochter Br&uuml;der schmachten. Die in dem
Memoire zitierten Aufrufe und Reden &auml;hnlichen Charakters
beleuchten die vielseitige ausw&auml;rtige T&auml;tigkeit der
Narodna Oobrana und ihrer affilierten Vereine, die in
Vortragsreifen, in der Teilnahme an Festen von bosnischen Vereinen,
bei denen offen Mitglieder f&uuml;r die erw&auml;hnte serbische
Vereinigung geworben wurden, besteht. Gegenw&auml;rtig ist noch die
Untersuchung dar&uuml;ber im Zuge, dass die Sokolvereine Serbiens
analoge Vereinigungen der Monarchie bestimmten, sich mit ihnen in
einem bisher geheim gehaltenen Verbande zu vereinigen. Durch
Vertrauensm&auml;nner und Mission&auml;re wurde die Aufwiegelung in
die Kreise Erwachsener und der urteilslosen Jugend gebracht. So
wurden von Milan Pribicewitsch ehmalige honvedoffiziere und ein
Gendarmerieleutnant zum Verlassen des Heeresdienstes in der
Monarchie unter bedenklichen Umst&auml;nden verleitet. In den
Schulen der Lehrerbildungsanstalten wurde eine weitgehende
Agitation entwickelt. Der gew&uuml;nschte Krieg gegen die Monarchie
wurde milit&auml;risch auch insofern vorbereitet, als serbische
Emiss&auml;re im Falle des Ausbruchs der Feindseligkeiten mit der
Zerst&ouml;rung von Transportmitteln usw., der Anfachung von
Revolten und Paniken betraut wurden. Alles dies wird in einer
besonderen Beilage belegt.</p>
<p>Das Memoire schildert ferner den Zusammenhang zwischen dieser
T&auml;tigkeit der Narodna Oobrana und den affilierten
Organisationen mit den Attentaten gegen den K&ouml;niglichen
Kommiss&auml;r in Agram Cuvaj im Juli 1912, dem Attentat von Dojcic
in Agram 1913 gegen Sterlecz und dem missgl&uuml;ckten Attentat
Sch&auml;fers am 20. Mai im Aramer Theater. Es verbreitet sich
hierauf &uuml;ber den Zusammenhang des Attentats auf den
Thronfolger und dessen Gemahlin, &uuml;ber die Art, wie sich die
Jungen schon in der Schule an dem Gedanken der Narodna Dobrana
vergifteten und wie sich die Attent&auml;ter mit Hilfe von
Pribicewic und Dacic die Werkzeuge zu dem Attentat verschafften,
wobei insbesondere die Rolle des Majors Tankofte dargelegt wird,
der die Mordwass&euml;n lieferte, wie auch die Rolle eines gewissen
Ciganovic, eines gewesenen Komitatschi und jetzigen Beamten der
serbischen Eisenbahndirektion Belgrad, der schon 1909 als
Z&ouml;gling der Bandenschule der damaligen Narodna Odbrana
austauchte. Ferner wird die Art dargelegt, wie Bomben und Waffen
unbemerkt nach Bosnien eingeschmuggelt wurden, die keinen Zweifel
dar&uuml;ber l&auml;sst, dass dies ein wohl voerberiteter und
f&uuml;r die geheimnisvollen Zwecke der Narodna oft begangener
Schleichweg war.</p>
<p>Eine Beilage enth&auml;lt einen Auszug aus den Akten des
Kreisgerichts in Serajewo &uuml;ber die Untersuchung des Attentats
gegen den Erzherzog Franz Ferdinand und dessen Gemahlin. Danach
sind Princip, Cabrinovic, Grabez, Crupilovic und Papovic
gest&auml;ndig, in Gemeinschaft mit dem fl&uuml;chtigen Mehmedbasic
ein Komplott zur Erwordung des Erzherzogs gebildet und ihm zu
diesen Zweck aufgelauert zu haben. Cabrinovic ist gest&auml;ndig,
die Bombe geworfen und Gabrilo Princip das Attentat mit der
Browningpistole ausgef&uuml;hrt zu haben. Beide T&auml;ter gaben
zu, bei der Ver&uuml;bung der Tat die Absicht des Mordes gehabt zu
haben. Die weiteren Teile der Anlage enthalten weitere Angaben der
Beschuldigten vor dem Untersuchungsrichter &uuml;ber Entstehung des
Komplotts, Herkunft der Bomben, welche fabrikm&auml;ssig
hergestellt wurden, f&uuml;r millit&auml;rische Zwecke bestimmt
waren und ihrer Originalpackung nach aus dem serbischen Waffenlager
aus Kragujevac stammten. Endlich gibt die Beilage Auskunft
&uuml;ber den Transport der drei Attent&auml;ter und der Waffen von
Serbien nach Bosnien. Aus dem weiteren Zeugenprotokoll ergibt sich,
dass ein Angeh&ouml;riger der Monarchie einige Tage vor dem
Attentat dem &ouml;sterreichisch-ungarischen Konsulat in Belgrad
Meldung von der Vermutung erstatten wollte, dass ein Plan zur
Ver&uuml;bung des Attentats gegen den Erzherzog w&auml;hrend dessen
Anwesenheit in Bosnien bestehe. Dieser Mann soll nun durch
Belgrader Polizeiorgane, welche ihn unmittelbar vor Betreten des
Konsulats aus nichtigen Gr&uuml;nden verhafteten, an der Erstattung
der Meldung verhindert worden sein. Weiter gehe aus dem
Zeugenprotokoll hervor, dass die betreffenden Polizeiorgane von dem
geplanten Attentat Kenntnis gehabt h&auml;tten. Da diese Angaben
noch nicht nachgepr&uuml;ft sind, kann &uuml;ber deren
Stichhaltigkeit vorl&auml;ufig noch kein Urteil gef&auml;llt
werden. In der Beilage zum Memoire heisst es: Vor dem Empfangssaal
des serbischen Kriegsministeriums befinden sich an der Wand vier
allegorische Bilder, von denen drei Darstellungen serbischer
Kriegserfolge sind, w&auml;hrend das vierte die Verwirklichung der
monarchiefeindlichen Tendenzen Serbiens versinnbildlicht. Ueber
einer Landschaft, die teils Gebirge (Bosnien), teils Ebene
(S&uuml;dungarn) darstellt, geht die Zora, die Morgenr&ouml;te der
serbischen Hoffnungen, auf. Im Vordergrunde steht eine bewaffnete
Frauengestalt, auf deren Schilde die Namen aller "noch zu
befreienden Provinzen": Bosnien, Herzegowina, Wojwodina, Gyrmien,
Dalmatien usw. stehen.</p>

<h2>APPENDIX V</h2>
<p>Extract from the Dispatch from His Majesty's Ambassador at
Vienna respecting the Rupture of Diplomatic Relations with the
Austro-Hungarian Government.</p>
<p>(Cd. 7596)</p>
<p><i>Sir M. de Bunsen to Sir Edward Grey</i>.</p>
<p><i>London, September</i> 1, 1914.</p>
<p>Sir,</p>
<p>The rapidity of the march of events during the days which led up
to the outbreak of the European war made it difficult, at the time,
to do more than record their progress by telegraph. I propose now
to add a few comments.</p>
<p>The delivery at Belgrade on the 23rd July of the Austrian note
to Servia was preceded by a period of absolute silence at the
Ballplatz. Except Herr von Tchinsky, who must have been aware of
the tenour, if not of the actual words of the note, none of my
colleagues were allowed to see through the veil. On the 22nd and
23rd July, M. Dumaine, French Ambassador, had long interviews with
Baron Macchio, one of the Under-Secretaries of State for Foreign
Affairs, by whom he was left under the impression that the words of
warning he had been instructed to speak to the Austro-Hungarian
Government had not been unavailing, and that the note which was
being drawn up would be found to contain nothing with which a
self-respecting State need hesitate to comply. At the second of
these interviews he was not even informed that the note was at that
very moment being presented at Belgrade, or that it would be
published in Vienna on the following morning. Count Forgach, the
other Under-Secretary of State, had indeed been good enough to
confide to me on the same day the true character of the note, and
the fact of its presentation about the time we were speaking.</p>
<p>So little had the Russian Ambassador been made aware of what was
preparing that he actually left Vienna on a fortnight's leave of
absence about the 20th July. He had only been absent a few days
when events compelled him to return. It might have been supposed
that Duc Avarna, Ambassador of the allied Italian Kingdom, which
was bound to be so closely affected by fresh complications in the
Balkans, would have been taken fully into the confidence of Count
Berchtold during this critical time. In point of fact his
Excellency was left completely in the dark. As for myself, no
indication was given me by Count Berchtold of the impending storm,
and it was from a private source that I received on the 15th July
the forecast of what was about to happen which I telegraphed to you
the following day. It is true that during all this time the "Neue
Freie Presse" and other leading Viennese newspapers were using
language which pointed unmistakably to war with Servia. The
official "Fremdenblatt", however, was more cautious, and till the
note was published, the prevailing opinion among my colleagues was
that Austria would shrink from courses calculated to involve her in
grave European complications.</p>
<p>On the 24th July the note was published in the newspapers. By
common consent it was at once styled an ultimatum. Its integral
acceptance by Servia was neither expected nor desired, and when, on
the following afternoon, it was at first rumoured in Vienna that it
had been unconditionally accepted, there was a moment of keen
disappointment. The mistake was quickly corrected, and as soon as
it was known later in the evening that the Servian reply had been
rejected and that Baron Giesl had broken off relations at Belgrade,
Vienna burst into a frenzy of delight, vast crowds parading the
streets and singing patriotic songs till the small hours of the
morning.</p>
<p>The demonstrations were perfectly orderly, consisting for the
most part of organised processions through the principal streets
ending up at the Ministry of War. One or two attempts to make
hostile manifestations against the Russian Embassy were frustrated
by the strong guard of police which held the approaches to the
principal embassies during those days. The demeanour of the people
at Vienna, and, as I was informed, in many other principal cities
of the Monarchy, showed plainly the popularity of the idea of war
with Servia, and there can be no doubt that the small body of
Austrian and Hungarian statesmen by whom this momentous step was
adopted gauged rightly the sense, and it may even be said the
determination, of the people, except presumably in portions of the
provinces inhabited by the Slav races. There had been much
disappointment in many quarters at the avoidance of war with Servia
during the annexation crisis in 1908 and again in connection with
the recent Balkan war. Count Berchtold's peace policy had met with
little sympathy in the Delegation. Now the flood-gates were opened,
and the entire people and press clamoured impatiently for immediate
and condign punishment of the hated Servian race. The country
certainly believed that it had before it only the alternative of
subduing Servia or of submitting sooner or later to mutilation at
her hands. But a peaceful solution should first have been
attempted. Few seemed to reflect that the forcible intervention of
a Great Power in the Balkans must inevitably call other Great
Powers into the field. So just was the cause of Austria held to be,
that it seemed to her people inconceivable that any country should
place itself in her path, or that questions of mere policy or
prestige should be regarded anywhere as superseding the necessity
which had arisen to exact summary vengeance for the crime of
Serajevo. The conviction had been expressed to me by the German
Ambassador on the 24th July that Russia would stand aside. This
feeling, which was also held at the Ballplatz, influenced no doubt
the course of events, and it is deplorable that no effort should
have been made to secure by means of diplomatic negotiations the
acquiescence of Russia and Europe as a whole in some peaceful
compromise of the Servian question by which Austrian fears of
Servian aggression and intrigue might have been removed for the
future. Instead of adopting this course the Austro-Hungarian
Government resolved upon war. The inevitable consequence ensued.
Russia replied to a partial Austrian mobilisation and declaration
of war against Servia by a partial Russian mobilisation against
Austria. Austria met this move by completing her own mobilisation,
and Russia again responded with results which have passed into
history. The fate of the proposals put forward by His Majesty's
Government for the preservation of peace is recorded in the White
Paper on the European Crisis[<a href="#note-191">191</a>]. On the
28th July I saw Count Berchtold and urged as strongly as I could
that the scheme of mediation mentioned in your speech in the House
of Commons on the previous day should be accepted as offering an
honourable and peaceful settlement of the question at issue. His
Excellency himself read to me a telegraphic report of the speech,
but added that matters had gone too far; Austria was that day
declaring war on Servia, and she could never accept the conference
which you had suggested should take place between the less
interested Powers on the basis of the Servian reply. This was a
matter which must be settled directly between the two parties
immediately concerned. I said His Majesty's Government would hear
with regret that hostilities could not be arrested, as you feared
they would lead to European complications. I disclaimed any British
lack of sympathy with Austria in the matter of her legitimate
grievances against Servia, and pointed out that, whereas Austria
seemed to be making these the starting point of her policy, His
Majesty's Government were bound to look at the question primarily
from the point of view of the maintenance of the peace of Europe.
In this way the two countries might easily drift apart.</p>
<p>His Excellency said that he too was keeping the European aspect
of the question in sight. He thought, however, that Russia would
have no right to intervene after receiving his assurance that
Austria sought no territorial aggrandisement. His Excellency
remarked to me in the course of his conversation that, though he
had been glad to co-operate towards bringing about the settlement
which had resulted from the ambassadorial conferences in London
during the Balkan crisis, he had never had much belief in the
permanency of that settlement, which was necessarily of a highly
artificial character, inasmuch as the interests which it sought to
harmonise were in themselves profoundly divergent. His Excellency
maintained a most friendly demeanour throughout the interview, but
left no doubt in my mind as to the determination of the
Austro-Hungarian Government to proceed with the invasion of
Servia.</p>
<p>The German Government claim to have persevered to the end in the
endeavour to support at Vienna your successive proposals in the
interest of peace. Herr von Tchirsky abstained from inviting my
co-operation or that of the French and Russian Ambassadors in
carrying out his instructions to that effect, and I had no means of
knowing what response he was receiving from the Austro-Hungarian
Government. I was, however, kept fully informed by M. Schebeko, the
Russian Ambassador, of his own direct negotiations with Count
Berchtold. M. Schebeko endeavoured on the 28th July to persuade the
Austro-Hungarian Government to furnish Count Sz&aacute;p&aacute;ry
with full powers to continue at St. Petersburgh the hopeful
conversations which had there been taking place between the latter
and M. Sazonof. Count Berchtold refused at the time, but two days
later (30th July), though in the meantime Russia had partially
mobilised against Austria, he received M. Schebeko again, in a
perfectly friendly manner, and gave his consent to the continuance
of the conversations at St. Petersburgh. From now onwards the
tension between Russia and Germany was much greater than between
Russia and Austria. As between the latter an arrangement seemed
almost in sight, and on the 1st August I was informed by M.
Schebeko that Count Sz&aacute;p&aacute;ry had at last conceded the
main point at issue by announcing to M. Sazonof that Austria would
consent to submit to mediation the points in the note to Servia
which seemed incompatible with the maintenance of Servian
independence. M. Sazonof, M. Schebeko added, had accepted this
proposal on condition that Austria would refrain from the actual
invasion of Servia. Austria, in fact, had finally yielded, and that
she herself had at this point good hopes of a peaceful issue is
shown by the communication made to you on the 1st August by Count
Mensdorff, to the effect that Austria had neither "banged the door"
on compromise nor cut off the conversations.[<a href=
"#note-192">192</a>] M. Schebeko to the end was working hard for
peace. He was holding the most conciliatory language to Count
Berchtold, and he informed me that the latter, as well as Count
Forgach, had responded in the same spirit. Certainly it was too
much for Russia to expect that Austria would hold back her armies,
but this matter could probably have been settled by negotiation,
and M. Schebeko repeatedly told me he was prepared to accept any
reasonable compromise.</p>
<p>Unfortunately these conversations at St. Petersburgh and Vienna
were cut short by the transfer of the dispute to the more dangerous
ground of a direct conflict between Germany and Russia. Germany
intervened on the 31st July by means of her double ultimatums to
St. Petersburgh and Paris. The ultimatums were of a kind to which
only one answer is possible, and Germany declared war on Russia on
the 1st August, and on France on the 3rd August. A few days' delay
might in all probability have saved Europe from one of the greatest
calamities in history.</p>
<p>Russia still abstained from attacking Austria, and M. Schebeko
had been instructed to remain at his post till war should actually
be declared against her by the Austro-Hungarian Government. This
only happened on the 6th August when Count Berchtold informed the
foreign missions at Vienna that "the Austro-Hungarian Ambassador at
St. Petersburgh had been instructed to notify the Russian
Government that, in view of the menacing attitude of Russia in the
Austro-Servian conflict and the fact that Russia had commenced
hostilities against Germany, Austria-Hungary considered herself
also at war with Russia."</p>
<p>M. Schebeko left quietly in a special train provided by the
Austro-Hungarian Government on the 7th September. He had urgently
requested to be conveyed to the Roumanian frontier, so that he
might be able to proceed to his own country, but was taken instead
to the Swiss frontier, and ten days later I found him at Berne.</p>
<p>M. Dumaine, French Ambassador, stayed on till the 12th August.
On the previous day he had been instructed to demand his passport
on the ground that Austrian troops were being employed against
France. This point was not fully cleared up when I left Vienna. On
the 9th August, M. Dumaine had received from Count Berchtold the
categorical declaration that no Austrian troops were being moved to
Alsace. The next day this statement was supplemented by a further
one, in writing, giving Count Berchtold's assurance that not only
had no Austrian troops been moved actually to the French frontier,
but that none were moving from Austria in a westerly direction into
Germany in such a way that they might replace German troops
employed at the front. These two statements were made by Count
Berchtold in reply to precise questions put to him by M. Dumaine,
under instructions from his Government. The French Ambassador's
departure was not attended by any hostile demonstration, but his
Excellency before leaving had been justly offended by a harangue
made by the Chief Burgomaster of Vienna to the crowd assembled
before the steps of the town hall, in which he assured the people
that Paris was in the throes of a revolution, and that the
President of the Republic had been assassinated.</p>
<p>The British declaration of war on Germany was made known in
Vienna by special editions of the newspapers about midday on the
5th August. An abstract of your speeches in the House of Commons,
and also of the German Chancellor's speech in the Reichstag of the
4th April, appeared the same day, as well as the text of the German
ultimatum to Belgium. Otherwise few details of the great events of
these days transpired. The "Neue Freie Presse" was violently
insulting towards England. The "Fremdenblatt" was not offensive,
but little or nothing was said in the columns of any Vienna paper
to explain that the violation of Belgian neutrality had left His
Majesty's Government no alternative but to take part in the
war.</p>
<p>The declaration of Italian neutrality was bitterly felt in
Vienna, but scarcely mentioned in the newspapers.</p>
<p>On the 5th August I had the honour to receive your instruction
of the previous day preparing me for the immediate outbreak of war
with Germany, but adding that, Austria being understood to be not
yet at that date at war with Russia and France, you did not desire
me to ask for my passport or to make any particular communication
to the Austro-Hungarian Government. You stated at the same time
that His Majesty's Government of course expected Austria not to
commit any act of war against us without the notice required by
diplomatic usage.</p>
<p>On Thursday morning, the 13th August, I had the honour to
receive your telegram of the 12th, stating that you had been
compelled to inform Count Mensdorff, at the request of the French
Government, that a complete rupture had occurred between France and
Austria, on the ground that Austria had declared war on Russia who
was already fighting on the side of France, and that Austria had
sent troops to the German frontier under conditions that were a
direct menace to France. The rupture having been brought about with
France in this way, I was to ask for my passport, and your telegram
stated, in conclusion, that you had informed Count Mensdorff that a
state of war would exist between the two countries from midnight of
the 12th August.</p>
<p>After seeing Mr. Penfield, the United States Ambassador, who
accepted immediately in the most friendly spirit my request that
his Excellency would take charge provisionally of British interests
in Austria-Hungary during the unfortunate interruption of
relations, I proceeded, with Mr. Theo Russell, Counsellor of His
Majesty's Embassy, to the Ballplatz. Count Berchtold received me at
midday. I delivered my message, for which his Excellency did not
seem to be unprepared, although he told me that a long telegram
from Count Mensdorff had just come in but had not yet been brought
to him. His Excellency received my communication with the courtesy
which never leaves him. He deplored the unhappy complications which
were drawing such good friends as Austria and England into war. In
point of fact, he added, Austria did not consider herself then at
war with France, though diplomatic relations with that country had
been broken off. I explained in a few words how circumstances had
forced this unwelcome conflict upon us. We both avoided useless
argument...</p>

<p>PREFATORY NOTE TO APPENDIX VI</p>
<p>This important collection of documents, which has only reached
us since the publication of our first edition, confirms the
conclusion, which we had deduced from other evidence in our fifth
chapter (<i>supra</i>, <a href="#CH5">pp. 66-107</a>), that Germany
consistently placed obstacles in the way of any proposals for a
peaceful settlement, and this in spite of the willingness of all
the other Powers, including Austria-Hungary and Russia, to continue
discussion of the Servian question. That the crisis took Russia by
surprise seems evident from the fact that her ambassadors
accredited to France, Berlin, and Vienna were not at their posts
when friction began with Russia. (<i>Infra</i>, Nos. 4, 7, 8.)</p>
<p>The Russian evidence shows that, on July 29, Germany threatened
to mobilize if Russia did not desist from military preparations.
This threat was viewed by M. Sazonof as an additional reason for
taking all precautions; 'since we cannot accede to Germany's
desire, the only course open to us is to accelerate our own
preparations and to assume that war is probably inevitable.'
(<i>Infra</i>, No. 58.) The reader will also notice the curious
fact that on July 30 the decree mobilizing the German army and navy
was published, only to be immediately withdrawn; and that the
German Government explained that the publication had been premature
and accidental. (<i>Infra</i>, Nos. 61, 62.) We know from the
British White Book (<i>Correspondence</i>, No. 99, Sir F. Bertie to
Sir E. Grey, July 30) that, on July 30, Germany showed signs of
weakening in her attitude to Russia.</p>
<p>It will be noted that war between Austria-Hungary and Russia was
not officially declared until August 6, five days after Germany had
declared war on Russia. (<i>Infra</i>, No. 79.)</p>
<p>In Nos. 36 and 46 will be found some curious details of the
methods employed by Austria-Hungary and Germany to delay the
publication of the Servian reply to Austria-Hungary.</p>

R&eacute;gent de Serbie &agrave; Sa Majest&eacute; l'Empereur.</p>
<p>Belgrade, le 11/24 Juillet 1914.</p>
<p>Le Gouvernement Austro-Hongrois a remis hier soir au
Gouvernement serbe une note concernant l'attentat de Sarajevo.
Consciente de ses devoirs internationaux, la Serbie d&egrave;s les
premiers jours de l'horrible crime a d&eacute;clar&eacute; qu'elle
le condamnait et qu'elle &eacute;tait pr&ecirc;te &agrave; ouvrir
une enqu&ecirc;te sur son territoire si la complicit&eacute; de
certains de ses sujets &eacute;tait prouv&eacute;e au cours du
proc&egrave;s instruit par les autorit&eacute;s Austro-hongroises.
Cependant les demandes contenues dans la note Austro-hongroise sont
inutilement humiliantes pour la Serbie et incompatibles avec sa
dignit&eacute; comme Etat ind&eacute;pendant. Ainsi on nous demande
sur un ton p&eacute;remptoire une d&eacute;claration du
gouvernement dans l'officiel et un ordre du souverain &agrave;
l'arm&eacute;e, o&ugrave; nous r&eacute;primerions l'esprit hostile
contre l'Autriche en nous faisant &agrave; nous m&ecirc;mes des
reproches d'une faiblesse criminelle envers nos men&eacute;es
perfides.&mdash;On nous impose ensuite l'admission des
fonctionnaires austro-hongrois en Serbie pour participer avec les
n&ocirc;tres &agrave; l'instruction et pour surveiller
l'ex&eacute;cution des autres conditions indiqu&eacute;es dans la
note. Nous avons re&ccedil;u un d&eacute;lai de 48 heures pour
accepter le tout, faute de quoi la L&eacute;gation
d'Autriche-Hongrie quittera Belgrade. Nous sommes pr&ecirc;ts
&agrave; accepter les conditions austro-hongroises qui sont
compatibles avec la situation d'un Etat ind&eacute;pendant, ainsi
que celles dont l'acception nous sera conseill&eacute;e par Votre
Majest&eacute;; toutes les personnes dont la participation &agrave;
l'attentat sera d&eacute;montr&eacute;e seront
s&eacute;v&egrave;rement punis par nous. Certaines parmi ces
demandes ne pourraient &ecirc;tre ex&eacute;cut&eacute;es sans des
changements de notre l&eacute;gislation, ce qui exige du temps. On
nous a donn&eacute; un d&eacute;lai trop court. Nous pouvons
&ecirc;tre attaqu&eacute;s apr&egrave;s l'expiration du
d&eacute;lai par l'arm&eacute;e austro-hongroise qui se concentre
sur notre fronti&egrave;re. Il nous est impossible de nous
d&eacute;fendre et nous supplions Votre Majest&eacute; de nous
donner Son aide le plus t&ocirc;t possible. La bienveillance
pr&eacute;cieuse de Votre Majest&eacute; qui s'est
manifest&eacute;e tant de fois &agrave; notre &eacute;gard nous
fait esp&eacute;rer fermement que cette fois encore notre appel
sera entendu par Son g&eacute;n&eacute;reux coeur slave.</p>
<p>En ces moments difficiles l'interpr&egrave;te les sentiments du
peuple serbe qui supplie Votre Majest&eacute; de vouloir bien
s'int&eacute;resser au sort du Royaume de Serbie.</p>

<p>Tous les journaux du matin, m&ecirc;me ceux, rares, qui
reconnaissent l'impossibilit&eacute; pour la Serbie d'accepter les
conditions pos&eacute;es, accueillent avec une grande sympathie le
ton &eacute;nergique adopt&eacute; par l'Autriche. L'officieux
&laquo;Local-Anzeiger&raquo; est particuli&egrave;rement agressif;
il qualifie de superflus les recours &eacute;ventuels de la Serbie
&agrave; St. P&eacute;tersbourg, &agrave; Paris, &agrave;
Ath&egrave;nes et &agrave; Bucarest, et termine en disant que le
peuple allemand respirera librement quand il aura appris que la

<p>La copie de la note officiellement remise &agrave; Belgrade a
&eacute;t&eacute; communiqu&eacute;e par l'Ambassadeur d'Autriche
an Gouvernement Fran&ccedil;ais. Plus tard l'Ambassadeur
d'Allemagne a visit&eacute; le Ministre et lui a lu une
communication reproduisant les arguments autrichiens et indiquant
qu'en cas de refus de la part de la Serbie, l'Autriche serait
oblig&eacute;e de recourir &agrave; une pression et, en cas de
besoin, &agrave; des mesures militaires; la communication se
terminait par la remarque qu'&agrave; l'avis de l'Allemagne cette
question devrait &ecirc;tre r&eacute;solue directement entre
l'Autriche et la Serbie et qu'il &eacute;tait de
l'int&eacute;r&ecirc;t des Puissances de circonscrire l'affaire en
l'abandonnant aux Parties int&eacute;ress&eacute;es. Le
G&eacute;rant du D&eacute;partement Politique, qui assistait
&agrave; l'entretien, demanda &agrave; l'Ambassadeur s'il fallait
consid&eacute;rer l'action autrichienne comme un ultimatum&mdash;en
d'autres termes, si, dans le cas o&ugrave; la Serbie ne se
soumettrait pas enti&egrave;rement aux demandes autrichiennes, les
hostilit&eacute;s &eacute;taient in&eacute;vitables? L'ambassadeur
&eacute;vita une r&eacute;ponse directe en all&eacute;guant
l'absence d'instructions.</p>

<p>Ai re&ccedil;u Votre t&eacute;l&eacute;gramme du 11/24 Juillet.
Ai communiqu&eacute; son contenu an Ministre des Affaires

prolongation du d&eacute;lai de l'ultimatum; il a communiqu&eacute;
cette d&eacute;marche t&eacute;l&eacute;graphiquement &agrave;

craint qu'&agrave; la suite de l'absence de Berchtold parti pour
Ischl, et vu le manque de temps, ses t&eacute;l&eacute;grammes ne
restent sans r&eacute;sultats; il a, en outre, des doutes sur
l'opportunit&eacute; pour l'Autriche de c&eacute;der an dernier
moment et il se demande si cela ne pouvait pas augmenter
l'assurance de la Serbie. J'ai r&eacute;pondu qu'une grande
Puissance comme l'Autriche pourrait c&eacute;der sans porter
atteinte &agrave; son prestige et ai fait valoir tous les arguments
conformes, cependant je n'ai pu obtenir des promesses plus
pr&eacute;cises. M&ecirc;me lorsque je laissais entendre qu'il
fallait agir &agrave; Vienne pour &eacute;viter la
possibilit&eacute; de cons&eacute;quences redoutables, le Ministre

expliqu&eacute; qu'on ne devrait pas attribuer &agrave; la note
autrichienne le caract&egrave;re d'un ultimatum; il faudrait la
consid&eacute;rer comme une d&eacute;marche qui, en cas d'absence
de r&eacute;ponse ou en cas de r&eacute;ponse insuffisante au terme
fix&eacute;, aurait comme suite la rupture des relations
diplomatiques et le d&eacute;part imm&eacute;diat de Belgrade du

ajout&eacute; qu'&agrave; la suite de cette explication il a
indiqu&eacute; &agrave; l'Ambassadeur d'Angleterre &agrave; Vienne
que dans le cas o&ugrave; il serait trop tard pour soulever la

impressionn&eacute; par ces divulgations, a visit&eacute;
aujourd'hui le G&eacute;rant du D&eacute;partement Politique pour
lui dire que ses paroles n'avaient nullement eu le caract&egrave;re
de menace qu'on leur attribue. Il a d&eacute;clar&eacute; que
l'Autriche avait pr&eacute;sent&eacute; sa note &agrave; la Serbie
sans entente pr&eacute;cise avec Berlin, mais que cependant
l'Allemagne approuvait le point de vue de l'Autriche et que
certainement 'la fl&egrave;che une fois partie' (ce sont l&agrave;
ses propres paroles), l'Allemagne ne pouvait se laisser guider que
par ses devoirs d'alli&eacute;e.</p>

&eacute;t&eacute; inform&eacute; du texte de la note autrichienne,

l'Angleterre pouvait consentir &agrave; agir &agrave; St.
P&eacute;tersbourg dans un esprit de conciliation. Grey a
r&eacute;pondu que cela &eacute;tait compl&egrave;tement
impossible. Le Ministre a ajout&eacute; que tant que les
complications n'existaient qu'entre l'Autriche et la Serbie, les
int&eacute;r&ecirc;ts Anglais n'&eacute;taient engag&eacute;s
qu'indirectement, mais qu'il devait pr&eacute;voir que la

int&eacute;ress&eacute;es toutes les Puissances. L'Angleterre se

<p>Grey a dit &agrave; l'Ambassadeur d'Allemagne qu'&agrave; son

guerre g&eacute;n&eacute;rale et qu'il ne voyait qu'un seul moyen
pour une solution pacifique: qu'en pr&eacute;sence des
mobilisations autrichienne et russe, l'Allemagne, la France,
l'Italie et l'Angleterre s'abstiennent d'une mobilisation
imm&eacute;diate et proposent tout d'abord leurs bons offices. Grey
m'a dit que ce plan n&eacute;cessitait avant tout l'agr&eacute;ment

13/26 Juillet 1914.</p>
<p>J'ai eu aujourd'hui un long entretien sur un ton amical avec
l'Ambassadeur d'Autriche-Hongrie. Apr&egrave;s avoir examin&eacute;
avec lui les 10 demandes adress&eacute;es &agrave; la Serbie, j'ai
fait observer qu'&agrave; part la forme peu habile sous laquelle
elles sont pr&eacute;sent&eacute;es, quelques-unes parmi elles sont
absolument inex&eacute;cutables, m&ecirc;me dans le cas o&ugrave;
le gouvernement Serbe d&eacute;clarerait les vouloir accepter.
Ainsi, par exemple, les points 1 et 2 ne pourraient &ecirc;tre
ex&eacute;cut&eacute;s sans un remaniement des lois serbes sur la
presse et sur les associations, pour lequel le consentement de la
Scoupchtina pourrait &ecirc;tre difficilement obtenu; quant
&agrave; l'ex&eacute;cution des points 4 et 5, elle pourrait
produire des cons&eacute;quences fort dangereuses et m&ecirc;me
faire na&icirc;tre le danger d'actes de terrorisme dirig&eacute;s
contre les membres de la Maison Royale et contre Pachitch, ce qui
ne saurait entrer dans les vues de l'Autriche. En ce qui regarde
les autres points, il me semble, qu'avec certains changements dans
les d&eacute;tails, il ne serait pas difficile de trouver un
terrain d'entente si les accusations y contenues &eacute;taient
confirm&eacute;es par des preuves suffisantes.</p>
<p>Dans l'int&eacute;r&ecirc;t de la conservation de la paix qui,
aux dires de Sz&aacute;p&aacute;ry, est pr&eacute;cieuse &agrave;
l'Autriche au m&ecirc;me degr&eacute; qu'&agrave; toutes les
Puissances, il serait n&eacute;cessaire de mettre au plus t&ocirc;t
possible une fin &agrave; la situation tendue du moment. Dans ce
but il me semblerait tr&egrave;s d&eacute;sirable que l'Ambassadeur
d'Autriche-Hongrie f&ucirc;t autoris&eacute; d'entrer avec moi dans
un &eacute;change de vues priv&eacute; aux fins d'un remaniement en
commun de quelques articles de la note autrichienne du 10/23
Juillet. Ce proc&eacute;d&eacute; permettrait peut-&ecirc;tre de
trouver une formule qui f&ucirc;t acceptable pour la Serbie, tout
en donnant satisfaction &agrave; l'Autriche quant au fond de ses
demandes. Veuillez avoir une explication prudente et amicale dans
le sens de ce t&eacute;l&eacute;gramme avec le Ministre des
Affaires Etrang&egrave;res. Communiqu&eacute; aux Ambassadeurs en

<p>Aujourd'hui l'Ambassadeur d'Allemagne a de nouveau rendu visite

<p>&laquo;L'Autriche a d&eacute;clar&eacute; &agrave; la Russie
qu'elle ne recherche pas des acquisitions territoriales et qu'elle
ne menace pas l'int&eacute;grit&eacute; de la Serbie. Son but
unique est d'assurer sa propre tranquillit&eacute;. Par
cons&eacute;quent il d&eacute;pend de la Russie d'&eacute;viter la
guerre. L'Allemagne se sent solidaire avec la France dans le
d&eacute;sir ardent de conserver la paix et esp&egrave;re fermement
que la France usera de son influence &agrave; P&eacute;tersbourg
dans un sens mod&eacute;rateur&raquo;. Le Ministre fit observer que
l'Allemagne pourrait de son c&ocirc;t&eacute; entreprendre des
d&eacute;marches analogues &agrave; Vienne, surtout en
pr&eacute;sence de l'esprit de conciliation dont a fait preuve la
Serbie. L'Ambassadeur r&eacute;pondit que cela n'&eacute;tait pas
possible, vu la r&eacute;solution prise de ne pas s'immiscer dans
le conflit austro-serbe. Alors le Ministre demanda, si les quatre
Puissances&mdash;l'Angleterre, l'Allemagne, l'Italie et la
France&mdash;ne pouvaient pas entreprendre des d&eacute;marches
&agrave; St. P&eacute;tersbourg et &agrave; Vienne, puisque
l'affaire se r&eacute;duisait en somme &agrave; un conflit entre la
Russie et l'Autriche. L'Ambassadeur all&eacute;gua l'absence
d'instructions. Finalement le Ministre refusa d'adh&eacute;rer
&agrave; la proposition allemande.</p>

confirm&eacute; par &eacute;crit sa d&eacute;claration d'hier,
savoir: 1) l'Autriche a d&eacute;clar&eacute; &agrave; la Russie
qu'elle ne recherche pas d'acquisitions et n'attente pas &agrave;
l'int&eacute;grit&eacute; de la Serbie. Son unique but est
d'assurer sa propre tranquillit&eacute;. 2) Par cons&eacute;quent
il d&eacute;pend de la Russie d'&eacute;viter la guerre. 3)
L'Allemagne et la France, compl&egrave;tement solidaires dans
l'ardent d&eacute;sir de ne pas rompre la paix, doivent agir sur la
Russie dans un sens mod&eacute;rateur. Le Baron de Schoen a
sp&eacute;cialement soulign&eacute; l'expression de la
solidarit&eacute; entre l'Allemagne et la France. D'apr&egrave;s la
conviction du Ministre de la Justice, les d&eacute;marches susdites
de l'Allemagne out pour but &eacute;vident de d&eacute;sunir la
Russie et la France, d'entra&icirc;ner le Gouvernement
Fran&ccedil;ais dans la voie des repr&eacute;sentations &agrave;
St. P&eacute;tersbourg et de compromettre ainsi notre alli&eacute;
&agrave; nos yeux; enfin, en cas de guerre, d'en rejeter la
responsabilit&eacute; non sur l'Allemagne, qui emploie soi-disant
tous ses efforts pour le maintien de la paix, mais sur la Russie et

<p>Aujourd'hui, avant ma visite au Ministre des Affaires
Etrang&egrave;res, ce dernier avait re&ccedil;u celle de
l'Ambassadeur de France qui avait tent&eacute; de lui faire
accepter la proposition anglaise relative &agrave; une action en
faveur de la paix, action qui serait exerc&eacute;e
simultan&eacute;ment &agrave; St.-P&eacute;tersbourg et &agrave;
Vienne par l'Angleterre, l'Allemagne, l'Italie et la France. Cambon
a propos&eacute; que ces Puissances donnent &agrave; Vienne un
conseil dans les termes suivants: &laquo;S'abstenir de tout acte
qui pourrait aggraver la situation de l'heure actuelle&raquo;. En
adoptant cette formule voil&eacute;e on &eacute;viterait de
mentionner la n&eacute;cessit&eacute; de s'abstenir d'une invasion
de la Serbie. Jagow a oppos&eacute; &agrave; cette proposition un
refus cat&eacute;gorique, et cela malgr&eacute; les instances de
l'Ambassadeur qui a fait valoir, comme un bon c&ocirc;te de la
proposition, le groupement mixte des Puissances gr&acirc;ce auquel
on &eacute;vitait l'opposition de l'Alliance &agrave; l'Entente, ce
dont s'&eacute;tait si souvent plaint Jagow lui-m&ecirc;me.</p>

<p>Le Ministre des Affaires Etrang&egrave;res est absent. Pendant
un entretien prolong&eacute;, que j'ai eu aujourd'hui avec Macchio,
j'ai, en termes tout &agrave; fait amicaux, attir&eacute; son
attention sur l'impression d&eacute;favorable qu'a produite en
Russie la pr&eacute;sentation par l'Autriche &agrave; la Serbie de
demandes absolument inacceptables pour chaque &eacute;tat
ind&eacute;pendant, bien que petit. J'ai ajout&eacute; que ce
proc&eacute;d&eacute;, qui pourrait amener des complications les
moins d&eacute;sirables, a provoqu&eacute; en Russie une profonde
surprise et une r&eacute;probation g&eacute;n&eacute;rale. Il faut
supposer que l'Autriche, sous l'influence des assurances du
Repr&eacute;sentant Allemand &agrave; Vienne, lequel pendant toute
cette crise a jou&eacute; un r&ocirc;le d'instigateur, a
compt&eacute; sur la probabilit&eacute; de la localisation de son
conflit avec la Serbie et sur la possibilit&eacute; de porter
&agrave; cette derni&egrave;re impun&eacute;ment un coup grave. La
d&eacute;claration du Gouvernement Imp&eacute;rial concernant
l'impossibilit&eacute; pour la Russie de rester indiff&eacute;rente

<p>(<i>T&eacute;l&eacute;gramme</i>). Londres, le 14/17 Juillet
1914.[<a href="#note-195">195</a>]</p>
<p>Grey vient de r&eacute;pondre &agrave; l'Ambassadeur
d'Allemagne, qui &eacute;tait venu le questionner sur la
possibilit&eacute; d'une action &agrave; St.-P&eacute;tersbourg,
que cette action devrait se produire &agrave; Vienne et que le
cabinet de Berlin serait le mieux qualifi&eacute; pour l'exercer.
Grey a fait observer en m&ecirc;me temps que la r&eacute;ponse
serbe &agrave; la note autrichienne d&eacute;passait par sa
mod&eacute;ration et son esprit de conciliation tout ce &agrave;
quoi on pouvait s'attendre. Grey a ajout&eacute; qu'il en concluait
que la Russie avait conseill&eacute; &agrave; Belgrade de donner
une r&eacute;ponse mod&eacute;r&eacute;e et qu'il pensait que la
r&eacute;ponse serbe pouvait servir de base &agrave; une solution
pacifique et acceptable de la question.</p>
<p>Dans ces conditions, a continu&eacute; Grey, si l'Autriche
malgr&eacute; cette r&eacute;ponse commen&ccedil;ait les
hostilit&eacute;s, elle prouverait son intention d'an&eacute;antir
la Serbie. La question plac&eacute;e sur ce terrain produirait une
situation qui pourrait amener une guerre dans laquelle seraient
impliqu&eacute;es toutes les Puissances.</p>
<p>Grey a enfin d&eacute;clar&eacute; que le Gouvernement Anglais
&eacute;tait bien sinc&egrave;rement dispos&eacute; &agrave;
collaborer avec le gouvernement Allemand tant qu'il s'agirait de la
conservation de la paix; mais que pour le cas contraire
l'Angleterre se r&eacute;servait une pleine libert&eacute;
d'action.</p>

<p>En pr&eacute;sence des hostilit&eacute;s entre
l'Autriche-Hongrie et la Serbie il est n&eacute;cessaire que
l'Angleterre entreprenne d'urgence une action m&eacute;diatrice et
que l'action militaire de l'Autriche contre la Serbie soit

<p>Sur ma question s'il avait une r&eacute;ponse de Vienne
relativement &agrave; Votre proposition de pourparlers
priv&eacute;s &agrave; St.-P&eacute;tersbourg, le Secr&eacute;taire
d'Etat a r&eacute;pondu n&eacute;gativement.</p>
<p>Il d&eacute;clare qu'il lui est fort difficile d'agir sur
Vienne, surtout ouvertement. Parlant &agrave; Cambon, il a
m&ecirc;me ajout&eacute; qu'en cas d'une pression trop
&eacute;vidente l'Autriche se h&acirc;terait de mettre l'Allemagne
en pr&eacute;sence d'un fait accompli.</p>
<p>Le Secr&eacute;taire d'Etat dit qu'il a re&ccedil;u aujourd'hui
un t&eacute;l&eacute;gramme de Pourtal&egrave;s d'o&ugrave; il
constate que plus que les premiers jours Vous &ecirc;tes
dispos&eacute; &agrave; trouver un compromis acceptable pour tous.
J'ai r&eacute;pliqu&eacute; que probablement Vous avez
&eacute;t&eacute; d&egrave;s le commencement en faveur d'un
compromis, bien entendu &agrave; la condition qu'il soit acceptable
non seulement pour l'Autriche, mais &eacute;galement pour nous. Il
m'a dit ensuite qu'il paraissait que nous avions commenc&eacute;
&agrave; mobiliser sur la fronti&egrave;re autrichienne et qu'il
craignait que ceci rendrait plus difficile pour l'Autriche la
possibilit&eacute; de s'entendre avec nous, d'autant plus que
l'Autriche ne mobilisait que contre la Serbie et ne faisait pas de
pr&eacute;paratifs sur notre fronti&egrave;re. J'ai r&eacute;pondu
que, d'apr&egrave;s les renseignements dont je disposais,
l'Autriche mobilisait &eacute;galement sur notre fronti&egrave;re
et que par cons&eacute;quent nous devions prendre des mesures
analogues. J'ai ajout&eacute; que les mesures que nous avons
peut-&ecirc;tre prises de notre c&ocirc;t&eacute; n'&eacute;taient
nullement dirig&eacute;es contre l'Allemagne.</p>

<p>A l'occasion de l'arriv&eacute;e du Pr&eacute;sident de la
R&eacute;publique Fran&ccedil;ais le Ministre des Affaires
Etrang&egrave;res avait pr&eacute;par&eacute; un court
expos&eacute; de la situation politique actuelle, &agrave; pen
pr&egrave;s dans les termes suivants: L'Autriche, craignant la
d&eacute;composition int&eacute;rieure, s'est empar&eacute;e du
pr&eacute;texte de l'assassinat de l'Archiduc pour essayer
d'obtenir des garanties qui pourront rev&ecirc;tir la forme de
l'occupation des communications militaires serbes ou m&ecirc;me du
territoire serbe. L'Allemagne soutient l'Autriche. Le maintien de
la paix d&eacute;pend de la seule Russie, parce qu'il s'agit d'une
affaire qui doit &ecirc;tre &laquo;localis&eacute;e&raquo; entre
l'Autriche et la Serbie, c'est &agrave; dire de la punition de la
politique pr&eacute;c&eacute;dente de la Serbie et des garanties
pour l'avenir. De ceci l'Allemagne conclue qu'il faut exercer une
action mod&eacute;ratrice &agrave; P&eacute;tersbourg. Ce sophisme
a &eacute;t&eacute; r&eacute;fut&eacute; &agrave; Paris comme
&agrave; Londres. A Paris, le Baron de Schoen a en vain
t&acirc;ch&eacute; d'entra&icirc;ner la France &agrave; une action
solidaire avec l'Allemagne sur la Russie en faveur du maintien de
la paix. Les m&ecirc;mes tentatives out &eacute;t&eacute; faites
&agrave; Londres. Dans les deux capitales il a &eacute;t&eacute;
r&eacute;pondu que l'action devrait &ecirc;tre exerc&eacute;e
&agrave; Vienne, car les demandes excessives de l'Autriche, son
refus de discuter les rares r&eacute;serves de la Serbie, et la
d&eacute;claration de guerre menacent de provoquer la guerre
g&eacute;n&eacute;rale. La France et l'Angleterre ne peuvent
exercer une action mod&eacute;ratrice sur la Russie, laquelle
jusqu'ici a fait preuve de la plus grande mod&eacute;ration,
surtout en conseillant &agrave; la Serbie d'accepter ce qui
&eacute;tait possible de la note autrichienne. Aujourd'hui
l'Allemagne para&icirc;t renoncer &agrave; l'id&eacute;e d'une
action sur la Russie seule et incline vers une action
m&eacute;diatrice &agrave; P&eacute;tersbourg et &agrave; Vienne,
mais en m&ecirc;me temps l'Allemagne comme l'Autriche t&acirc;chent
de faire tra&icirc;ner l'affaire. L'Allemagne s'oppose &agrave; la
Conf&eacute;rence sans indiquer aucune autre mani&egrave;re d'agir
pratique. L'Autriche m&egrave;ne des pourparlers manifestement
dilatoires &agrave; P&eacute;tersbourg. En m&ecirc;me temps elle
prend des mesures actives, et si ces mesures sont
tol&eacute;r&eacute;es, ses pr&eacute;tentions augmenteront
proportionnellement. Il est tr&egrave;s d&eacute;sirable que la
Russie pr&ecirc;te tout son appui an projet de m&eacute;diation que
pr&eacute;sentera Sir E. Grey. Dans le cas contraire l'Autriche,
sous pr&eacute;texte de &laquo;garantie&raquo;, pourra, en fait,
changer le status territorial de l'Europe orientale.</p>

<p>Ai communiqu&eacute; le contenu de Vos t&eacute;l&eacute;grammes
du 15/28 Juillet &agrave; Grey. Il a d&eacute;clar&eacute;
aujourd'hui &agrave; l'Ambassadeur d'Allemagne que les pourparlers
directs entre la Russie et l'Autriche avaient &eacute;chou&eacute;,
et que les correspondants des journaux mandaient de
St.-P&eacute;tersbourg que la Russie mobilisait contre l'Autriche
&agrave; la suite de la mobilisation de cette derni&egrave;re. Grey
dit qu'en principe le Gouvernement Allemand s'est
d&eacute;clar&eacute; en faveur de la m&eacute;diation, mais qu'il
rencontre des difficult&eacute;s quant &agrave; la forme. Grey a
insist&eacute; pour que le Gouvernement Allemand indiqu&acirc;t la
forme laquelle &agrave; l'avis de l'Allemagne pourrait permettre
aux 4 Puissances d'exercer leur m&eacute;diation pour &eacute;viter

l'Angleterre la m&eacute;diation pourrait avoir lieu seulement dans

<p>Viviani vient de me confirmer l'enti&egrave;re r&eacute;solution
du Gouvernement Fran&ccedil;ais d'agir d'accord avec nous. Cette
r&eacute;solution est soutenue par les cercles les plus
&eacute;tendus et par les partis, y compris les
radicaux-socialistes, qui viennent de lui pr&eacute;senter une
d&eacute;claration exprimant la confiance absolue et les
dispositions patriotiques du groupe. D&egrave;s son arriv&eacute;e
&agrave; Paris, Viviani a t&eacute;l&eacute;graphi&eacute;
d'urgence &agrave; Londres que vu la cessation des pourparlers
directs entre P&eacute;tersbourg et Vienne il &eacute;tait
n&eacute;cessaire que le Cabinet de Londres renouvel&acirc;t le
plus t&ocirc;t possible sous telle ou autre forme sa proposition
concernant la m&eacute;diation des Puissances. Avant moi Viviani a
re&ccedil;u aujourd'hui l'Ambassadeur d'Allemagne qui lui a
renouvel&eacute; l'assurance des tendances pacifiques de
l'Allemagne. Viviani ayant fait observer que si l'Allemagne
d&eacute;sirait la paix elle devrait se h&acirc;ter
d'adh&eacute;rer &agrave; la proposition de m&eacute;diation
anglaise, le Baron Schoen a r&eacute;pondu que les mots
&laquo;conf&eacute;rence&raquo; ou &laquo;arbitrage&raquo;
effrayaient l'Autriche. Viviani a r&eacute;pliqu&eacute; qu'il ne
s'agissait pas de mots et qu'il serait facile de trouver une autre
forme de m&eacute;diation. D'apr&egrave;s l'avis du Baron de
Schoen, pour le succ&egrave;s des n&eacute;gociations entre les
Puissances il serait n&eacute;cessaire de savoir ce que l'Autriche
compterait demander &agrave; la Serbie. Viviani a r&eacute;pondu
que le Cabinet de Berlin pourrait bien facilement s'en
enqu&eacute;rir aupr&egrave;s de l'Autriche, mais qu'en attendant
la note responsive serbe pourrait servir de base &agrave; la
discussion; il a ajout&eacute; que la France d&eacute;sirait
sinc&egrave;rement la paix, mais qu'elle &eacute;tait en m&ecirc;me
temps r&eacute;solue d'agir en pleine harmonie avec ses
alli&eacute;s et amis, et que lui, le Baron de Schoen, avait pu se
convaincre que cette r&eacute;solution rencontrait la plus vive
approbation du pays.</p>

<p>Le Prince-R&eacute;gent a publi&eacute; hier un manifeste
sign&eacute; par tous les Ministres &agrave; l'occasion de la
d&eacute;claration de la guerre par l'Autriche &agrave; la Serbie.
Le manifeste se termine par les paroles suivantes:
&laquo;D&eacute;fendez de toutes vos forces vos foyers et la
Serbie&raquo;. Lors de l'ouverture solennelle de la Scouptchina, le
R&eacute;gent lut en son nom le discours du tr&ocirc;ne, an
d&eacute;but duquel il indiqua que le lieu de la convocation
d&eacute;montrait l'importance des &eacute;v&egrave;nements
actuels. Suit l'expos&eacute; des faits des derniers
jours&mdash;l'ultimatum autrichien, la r&eacute;ponse serbe, les
efforts du gouvernement Royal de faire tout ce qui &eacute;tait
compatible avec la dignit&eacute; de l'Etat pour &eacute;viter la
guerre et enfin l'agression arm&eacute;e du voisin plus puissant
contre la Serbie, aux c&ocirc;t&eacute;s de laquelle se tient le
Mont&eacute;n&eacute;gro. En passant &agrave; l'examen de
l'attitude des Puissances en pr&eacute;sence du conflit, le Prince
insista tout d'abord sur les sentiments dont est anim&eacute;e la
Russie et sur la Toute Gracieuse Communication de sa Majest&eacute;
l'Empereur disant que la Russie en aucun cas n'abandonnera la
Serbie. A chaque mention du nom de Sa Majest&eacute;
Imp&eacute;riale et de la Russie un &laquo;jivio&raquo; formidable
et f&eacute;brile secouait la salle des s&eacute;ances. Les marques
de sympathie de la part de la France et de l'Angleterre furent
aussi relev&eacute;es s&eacute;par&eacute;ment et
provoqu&egrave;rent des &laquo;jivio&raquo; d'approbation de la
part des d&eacute;put&eacute;s. Le discours du tr&ocirc;ne se
termine par la d&eacute;claration d'ouverture de la Scouptchina et

<p>Ai communiqu&eacute; le contenu de Vos t&eacute;l&eacute;grammes
du 16 et 17 Juillet &agrave; Grey lequel consid&egrave;re la
situation comme tr&egrave;s s&eacute;rieuse, mais d&eacute;sire
continuer les pourparlers. J'ai fait observer &agrave; Grey que
depuis que Vous lui aviez fait la proposition d'accepter tout ce
qu'il proposerait en faveur du maintien de la paix, pourvu que
l'Autriche ne p&ucirc;t profiter de ces atermoiements pour
&eacute;craser la Serbie, la situation dans laquelle Vous vous
trouviez s'&eacute;tait apparemment modifi&eacute;e. A cette
&eacute;poque nos rapports avec l'Allemagne n'&eacute;taient pas
compromis. Apr&egrave;s la d&eacute;claration de l'Ambassadeur
d'Allemagne &agrave; St.-P&eacute;tersbourg concernant la
mobilisation allemande, ces rapports avaient chang&eacute; et sa
demande avait re&ccedil;u de Votre part la seule r&eacute;ponse que
pouvait donner une grande Puissance. Lorsque l'Ambassadeur
d'Allemagne &eacute;tait revenu aupr&egrave;s de Vous et
s'&eacute;tait enquis de Vos conditions, Vous les aviez
formul&eacute;es dans des circonstances tout-&agrave;-fait
sp&eacute;ciales. J'ai en m&ecirc;me temps de nouveau
insist&eacute; aupr&egrave;s de Grey sur la n&eacute;cessit&eacute;
de prendre en consid&eacute;ration la situation nouvelle
cr&eacute;&eacute;e par la faute de l'Allemagne &agrave; la suite
de l'action de l'Ambassadeur d'Allemagne. Grey a r&eacute;pondu
qu'il le comprenait et qu'il tiendrait compte de ces arguments.</p>

quelle raison l'Angleterre prenait des mesures militaires sur terre

&agrave; la suite de la mobilisation contre l'Autriche, le
deviennent encore davantage en pr&eacute;sence des graves mesures

mesures analogues de la part de l'Allemagne. A cela j'ai
r&eacute;pondu que, d'apr&egrave;s des renseignements s&ucirc;rs
dont je disposais et qui &eacute;taient confirm&eacute;s par tous
nos compatriotes arrivant &agrave; Berlin, la prise contre nous des
mesures susdites se poursuivait &eacute;galement en Allemagne avec

<p>Note remise par l'Ambassadeur d'Allemagne &agrave;
St.-P&eacute;tersbourg le 19 Juillet 1914 &agrave; 7 h. 10 du
soir.</p>
<p>Le Gouvernement Imp&eacute;rial s'est efforc&eacute; d&egrave;s
les d&eacute;buts de la crise de la mener &agrave; une solution
pacifique. Se rendant &agrave; un d&eacute;sir qui lui en avait
&eacute;t&eacute; exprim&eacute; par Sa Majest&eacute; l'Empereur
de Russie, Sa Majest&eacute; l'Empereur d'Allemagne d'accord avec
l'Angleterre s'&eacute;tait appliqu&eacute; &agrave; accomplir un
r&ocirc;le m&eacute;diateur aupr&egrave;s des Cabinets de Vienne et
de St.-P&eacute;tersbourg, lorsque la Russie, sans en attendre le
r&eacute;sultat, proc&eacute;da &agrave; la mobilisation de la
totalit&eacute; de ses forces de terre et de mer. A la suite de
cette mesure mena&ccedil;ante motiv&eacute;e par aucun
pr&eacute;sage militaire de la part de l'Allemagne, l'Empire
Allemand s'est trouv&eacute; vis-&agrave;-vis d'un danger grave et
imminent. Si le Gouvernement Imp&eacute;rial e&ucirc;t
manqu&eacute; de parer &agrave; ce p&eacute;ril, il aurait
compromis la s&eacute;curit&eacute; et l'existence m&ecirc;me de
l'Allemagne. Par cons&eacute;quent le Gouvernement Allemand se vit
forc&eacute; de s'adresser au Gouvernement de Sa Majest&eacute;
l'Empereur de Toutes les Russies en insistant sur la cessation
desdits actes militaires. La Russie ayant refus&eacute; de faire
droit &agrave; (n'ayant pas cru devoir r&eacute;pondre
&agrave;[<a href="#note-198">198</a>]) cette demande et ayant
manifest&eacute; par ce refus (cette attitude [<a href=

<p>Communiqu&eacute; du Ministre des Affaires Etrang&egrave;res
concernant les &eacute;v&eacute;nements des derniers jours.</p>
<p>Le 20 Juillet/2 Ao&ucirc;t 1914.</p>
<p>Un expos&eacute; d&eacute;figurant les &eacute;v&eacute;nements
des derniers jours ayant paru dans la presse
&eacute;trang&egrave;re, le Minist&egrave;re des Affaires
Etrang&egrave;res croit de son devoir de publier l'aper&ccedil;u
suivant des pourparlers diplomatiques pendant le temps
susvis&eacute;.</p>
<p>Le 10/23 Juillet a.c. le Ministre d'Autriche-Hongrie &agrave;
Belgrade pr&eacute;senta an Ministre Pr&eacute;sident Serbe une
note o&ugrave; le Gouvernement Serbe &eacute;tait accus&eacute;
d'avoir favoris&eacute; le mouvement panserbe qui avait abouti
&agrave; l'assassinat de l'h&eacute;ritier du tr&ocirc;ne
austro-hongrois. En cons&eacute;quence l'Autriche-Hongrie demandait
au Gouvernement Serbe non seulement de condamner sous une forme
solennelle la susdite propagande, mais aussi de prendre, sous le
contr&ocirc;le de l'Autriche-Hongrie, une s&eacute;rie de mesures
tendant &agrave; la d&eacute;couverte du complot, &agrave; la
punition des sujets serbes y ayant particip&eacute; et &agrave; la
pr&eacute;vention dans l'avenir de tout attentat sur le sol du
Royaume. Un d&eacute;lai de 48 heures fut fix&eacute; au
Gouvernement Serbe pour la r&eacute;ponse &agrave; la susdite
note.</p>
<p>Le Gouvernement Imp&eacute;rial, auquel l'Ambassadeur
d'Autriche-Hongrie &agrave; St.-P&eacute;tersbourg avait
communiqu&eacute; le texte de la note 17 heures apr&egrave;s sa
remise &agrave; Belgrade, ayant pris connaissance des demandes y
contenues, dut s'apercevoir que quelques-unes parmi elles
&eacute;taient inex&eacute;cutables quant an fond, tandis que
d'autres &eacute;taient pr&eacute;sent&eacute;es sous une forme
incompatible avec la dignit&eacute; d'un Etat ind&eacute;pendant.
Trouvant inadmissibles la diminution de la dignit&eacute; de la
Serbie contenue dans ces demandes, ainsi que la tendance de
l'Autriche-Hongrie d'assurer sa pr&eacute;pond&eacute;rance dans
les Balcans d&eacute;montr&eacute;e par ces m&ecirc;mes exigences,
le Gouvernement Russe fit observer dans la forme la plus amicale
&agrave; l'Autriche-Hongrie qu'il serait d&eacute;sirable de
soumettre &agrave; un nouvel examen les points contenus dans la
note austro-hongroise. Le Gouvernement Austro-Hongrois ne crut
possible de consentir &agrave; une discussion de la note. L'action
mod&eacute;ratrice des autres Puissances &agrave; Vienne ne fut non
plus couronn&eacute;e de succ&egrave;s.</p>
<p>Malgr&eacute; que la Serbie e&ucirc;t reprouv&eacute; le crime
et se f&ucirc;t montr&eacute;e pr&ecirc;te &agrave; donner
satisfaction &agrave; l'Autriche dans une mesure qui d&eacute;passa
les pr&eacute;visions non seulement de la Russie, mais aussi des
autres Puissances, le Ministre d'Autriche-Hongrie &agrave; Belgrade
jugea la r&eacute;ponse serbe insuffisante et quitta cette
ville.</p>
<p>Reconnaissant le caract&egrave;re exag&eacute;r&eacute; des
demandes pr&eacute;sent&eacute;es par l'Autriche, la Russie avait
d&eacute;clar&eacute; encore auparavant qu'il lui serait impossible
de rester indiff&eacute;rente, sans se refuser toutefois &agrave;
employer tous ses efforts pour trouver une issue pacifique qui
f&ucirc;t acceptable pour l'Autriche et m&eacute;nage&acirc;t son
amour-propre de grande puissance. En m&ecirc;me temps la Russie
&eacute;tablit fermement qu'elle admettait une solution pacifique
de la question seulement dans une mesure qui n'impliquerait pas la
diminution de la dignit&eacute; de la Serbie comme Etat
ind&eacute;pendant. Malheureusement tous les efforts
d&eacute;ploy&eacute;s par le Gouvernement Imp&eacute;rial dans
cette direction rest&egrave;rent sans effet. Le Gouvernement
Austro-Hongrois, apr&egrave;s s'&ecirc;tre d&eacute;rob&eacute;
&agrave; toute intervention conciliatrice des Puissances dans son
conflit avec la Serbie, proc&eacute;da &agrave; la mobilisation,
d&eacute;clara officiellement la guerre &agrave; la Serbie, et le
jour suivant Belgrade fut bombard&eacute;e. Le manifeste qui a
accompagn&eacute; la d&eacute;claration de guerre accuse
ouvertement la Serbie d'avoir pr&eacute;par&eacute; et
ex&eacute;cut&eacute; le crime de Sera&iuml;ewo. Une pareille
accusation d'un crime de droit commun lanc&eacute;e contre tout un
peuple et tout un &Eacute;tat attira &agrave; la Serbie par son
inanit&eacute; &eacute;vidente les larges sympathies des cercles de
la soci&eacute;t&eacute; europ&eacute;enne.</p>
<p>A la suite de cette mani&egrave;re d'agir du Gouvernement
Austro-Hongrois, malgr&eacute; la d&eacute;claration de la Russie
qu'elle ne pourrait rester indiff&eacute;rente au sort de la
Serbie, le Gouvernement Imp&eacute;rial jugea n&eacute;cessaire
d'ordonner la mobilisation des circonscriptions militaires de Kiew,
d'Odessa, de Moscou et de Kazan. Une telle d&eacute;cision
s'imposait parce que depuis la date de la remise de la note
austro-hongroise au Gouvernement Serbe et les premi&egrave;res
d&eacute;marches de la Russie cinq jours s'&eacute;taient
&eacute;coul&eacute;s, et cependant le Cabinet de Vienne n'avait
fait aucun pas pour aller au-devant de nos efforts pacifiques; au
contraire, la mobilisation de la moiti&eacute; de l'arm&eacute;e
austro-hongroise avait &eacute;t&eacute;
d&eacute;cr&eacute;t&eacute;e.</p>
<p>Le Gouvernement Allemand fut mis au courant des mesures prises
par la Russie; il lui fut en m&ecirc;me temps expliqu&eacute;
qu'elles n'&eacute;taient que la cons&eacute;quence des armements
autrichiens et nullement dirig&eacute;es contre l'Allemagne. En
m&ecirc;me temps, le Gouvernement Imp&eacute;rial d&eacute;clara
que la Russie &eacute;tait pr&ecirc;te &agrave; continuer les
pourparlers en vue d'une solution pacifique du conflit, soit par la
voie de n&eacute;gociations directes avec le Cabinet de Vienne,
soit en suivant la proposition de la Grande-Bretagne, par la voie
d'une Conf&eacute;rence des quatre Grandes Puissances non
int&eacute;ress&eacute;es directement, voire l'Angleterre, la
France, l'Allemagne et l'Italie.</p>
<p>Cependant cette tentative de la Russie &eacute;choua
&eacute;galement. L'Autriche-Hongrie d&eacute;clina un
&eacute;change de vues ult&eacute;rieur avec nous, et le Cabinet de
Vienne se d&eacute;roba &agrave; la participation &agrave; la
Conf&eacute;rence des Puissances projet&eacute;e.</p>
<p>N&eacute;anmoins, la Russie ne discontinua pas ses efforts en
faveur de la paix. R&eacute;pondant &agrave; la question de
l'Ambassadeur d'Allemagne, &agrave; quelles conditions nous
consentirions encore &agrave; suspendre nos armements, le Ministre
des Affaires Etrang&egrave;res d&eacute;clara que ces conditions
seraient la reconnaissance par l'Autriche-Hongrie que la question
Austro-Serbe avait rev&ecirc;tu le caract&egrave;re d'une question
europ&eacute;enne, et la d&eacute;claration de cette m&ecirc;me
Puissance qu'elle consentait &agrave; ne pas insister sur des
demandes incompatibles avec les droits souverains de la Serbie.</p>
<p>La proposition de la Russie fut jug&eacute;e par l'Allemagne
inacceptable pour l'Autriche-Hongrie. Simultan&eacute;ment on
re&ccedil;ut &agrave; St.-P&eacute;tersbourg la nouvelle de la
proclamation de la mobilisation g&eacute;n&eacute;rale par
l'Autriche-Hongrie.</p>
<p>En m&ecirc;me temps les hostilit&eacute;s continuaient sur le
territoire Serbe et Belgrade fut bombard&eacute;e derechef.</p>
<p>L'insucc&egrave;s de nos propositions pacifiques nous obligea
d'&eacute;largir les mesures de pr&eacute;caution militaires.</p>
<p>Le Cabinet de Berlin nous ayant adress&eacute; une question
&agrave; ce sujet, il lui fut r&eacute;pondu que la Russie
&eacute;tait forc&eacute;e de commencer ses armements pour se
pr&eacute;munir contre toutes &eacute;ventualit&eacute;s.</p>
<p>Tout en prenant cette mesure de pr&eacute;caution, la Russie
n'en discontinuait pas moins de rechercher de toutes ses forces une
issue de cette situation et d&eacute;clara &ecirc;tre pr&ecirc;te
&agrave; accepter tout moyen de solution du conflit qui
comporterait l'observation des conditions pos&eacute;es par
nous.</p>
<p>Malgr&eacute; cette communication conciliante, le Gouvernement
Allemand, le 18/31 Juillet, adressa au Gouvernement Russe la
demande d'avoir &agrave; suspendre ses mesures militaires &agrave;
midi du 19 Juillet/ 1 Ao&ucirc;t, en mena&ccedil;ant, dans le cas
contraire, de proc&eacute;der &agrave; une mobilisation
g&eacute;n&eacute;rale.</p>
<p>Le lendemain, 19 Juillet/1 Ao&ucirc;t, l'Ambassadeur d'Allemagne
transmit au Ministre des Affaires Etrang&egrave;res, an nom de son
Gouvernement, la d&eacute;claration de guerre.</p>

<p>Il est absolument clair que l'Allemagne s'efforce d&egrave;s
&agrave; pr&eacute;sent de rejeter sur nous la
responsabilit&eacute; de la rupture. Notre mobilisation a
&eacute;t&eacute; provoqu&eacute;e par l'&eacute;norme
responsabilit&eacute; que nous aurions assum&eacute;e, si nous
n'avions pas pris toutes les mesures de pr&eacute;caution &agrave;
un moment o&ugrave; l'Autriche, se bornant &agrave; des pourparlers
d'un caract&egrave;re dilatoire, bombardait Belgrade et

d&eacute;claration que nous accepterions avec joie toute issue
pacifique compatible avec la dignit&eacute; et

<p>Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is

Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
<a href="http://gutenberg.net/license">http://gutenberg.net/license)</a>.


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS,' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.net">http://www.gutenberg.net</a>

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

<a href="http://www.ibiblio.org/gutenberg/etext06">http://www.ibiblio.org/gutenberg/etext06</a>

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

http://www.gutenberg.net/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
http://www.gutenberg.net/2/4/6/8/24689
